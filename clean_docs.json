Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Cashing In on Clinical Trial Data : Can Blockchain Make it Happen?\n\nIn today\u2019s data-driven healthcare ecosystem, clinical trial data is one of the\nmost valuable assets for researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and healthcare\norganizations. However, accessing high-quality, reliable clinical trial data\nis often a complex and costly endeavor. This challenge has given rise to an\ninnovative solution that could transform the industry: a decentralized\nmarketplace for selling clinical trial data using blockchain technology.\n\n### **Unlocking Clinical Trial Data**\n\nClinical trials produce vast amounts of valuable data, including patient\ndemographics, lab results, and treatment outcomes. However, sharing and\nmonetizing this data presents significant challenges. One of the key issues is\ndata silos, where information is stored in isolated systems managed by\ndifferent entities, such as hospitals, research institutions, and\npharmaceutical companies. This fragmentation makes it difficult to access and\nconsolidate data effectively.\n\nAdditionally, privacy concerns and stringent regulations like HIPAA and GDPR\nfurther complicate data sharing, as ensuring patient confidentiality is\nparamount. The lack of transparency surrounding data integrity and provenance\nalso raises trust issues for buyers, who often struggle to verify the\nauthenticity of the information. Moreover, the high costs associated with\nobtaining high-quality clinical trial data can be a significant barrier,\nparticularly for smaller biotech companies and academic researchers.\n\n### **Blockchain - Powering a New Era for Clinical Trial Data**\n\nBlockchain technology offers a secure, transparent, and decentralized solution\nto the challenges of clinical trial data management. One of its key benefits\nis data transparency and provenance, where all transactions are recorded on an\nimmutable ledger. This guarantees that data buyers can verify the authenticity\nand origin of clinical trial data, receiving high-quality, reliable\ninformation. Blockchain also enables smart contracts, which automate\ntransactions, ensuring seamless, trustless data exchanges upon payment.\nFurthermore, data encryption ensures that patient privacy is maintained, with\nsensitive information stored off-chain while access permissions and audit\ntrails are recorded on the blockchain, allowing compliance with strict\nhealthcare regulations.\n\nBlockchain also revolutionizes how clinical trial data is monetized. Through\ntokenization, data can be split into smaller units and sold incrementally,\nmaking access to valuable segments of information more affordable. This\nenables researchers and institutions to sell anonymized data sets securely and\nefficiently, creating a new revenue stream for those generating clinical trial\ndata. The use of microtransactions, facilitated by cryptocurrency, allows even\nsmaller organizations to participate in the marketplace, democratizing access\nto critical research data.\n\n### **Key Features of the Clinical Trial Data Marketplace**\n\nThe marketplace for clinical trial data is designed to facilitate secure and\nefficient data sharing among stakeholders while ensuring compliance with\nregulatory standards. Below are the key modules that comprise this innovative\nplatform, each contributing to the overall functionality and integrity of the\nmarketplace. These features enable seamless data management, enhance\ncollaboration, and promote equitable revenue sharing among participants.\n\n**Feature**| **Description**  \n---|---  \nBlockchain| A blockchain platform for securely storing the signatures of\nclinical information.  \nDoctor & Patient Module| This module enables pharmaceutical companies and\nhospitals to enlist doctors and patients on the platform through an approval\nprocess. Once approved, patient data can be collected efficiently.  \nIoT Integration| An IoT ecosystem designed for collecting data from wearable\ndevices. This platform will initially serve demo purposes.  \nNFT Marketplace| Clinical trial data can be listed as NFTs. This feature will\nlink to a third-party NFT marketplace for purchasing options.  \nExchange Module| A secure exchange module for transferring data between\nparties.  \nTokenomics| A tokenomics framework to facilitate revenue sharing between\npatients and doctors.  \n  \n## **Challenges and Considerations**\n\nWhile blockchain offers significant potential, there are still challenges to\naddress:\n\n  * To make clinical trial data interoperable and easily exchangeable, there must be industry-wide standards for how the data is structured and labelled.  \n\n  * Navigating the complex landscape of healthcare regulations will require close collaboration with legal experts to ensure data privacy laws are adhered to.  \n\n  * Convincing stakeholders to adopt a blockchain-based system may be difficult due to technical limitations and the need for widespread industry participation.\n\n### **Blockchain - A New Frontier in Clinical Data Sharing**\n\nA blockchain-based marketplace for clinical trial data has the potential to\ntransform the way researchers and pharmaceutical companies access and share\ninformation. By providing a secure, transparent, and decentralized platform,\nblockchain can help unlock the full value of clinical trial data while\nprotecting patient privacy and ensuring data integrity.\n\nAs blockchain technology matures and adoption increases, we may soon witness\nthe rise of this revolutionary marketplace\u2014one that not only accelerates\nmedical research but also democratizes access to crucial data, fuelling\ninnovations in healthcare.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Interested in learning more about blockchain\u2019s role in healthcare?**\n\nConnect with our team at Simelabs, where we\u2019re building innovative solutions\nto transform healthcare data management and drive the future of clinical\ntrials.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

But how? Learn more!", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# EdgeXY\n\nFrom vision to the implementation of Industry 4.0\n\n**EdgeXY, a software suite by Simelabs was developed with a mission to build\nthe future of industries with evolving technology. It is a platform for\nimplementing the idea of Industry 4.0 where we see smart industries engaged in\naggregating, computing and exchanging data effortlessly. The integrated\ntechnologies enable smart usage of data and provide them with insights and\nthus paves the way for the next level ofdigital transformation**.\n\n## **Building a Strategy: Industry 4.0 and its impacts on your organisation**\n\nIndustrial 4.0 is the talk of the town at the moment and it refers to the\nfourth industrial revolution. As technology advances at lightning speed,\nindustries have evolved through various stages of the revolution. With the\nadvent of mechanisation, water power, steam power, electricity, mass\nproduction, computer and automation, industries have unfolded themselves from\nthe era of the first industrial revolution to the third industrial revolution.\nFirst one was triggered around the 1700s and over the years industries have\ngone through a lot of phases and it is the moment to proclaim the beginning of\nIndustry 4.0. The fourth industrial revolution, which has just started and\nreferred to as Industry 4.0 is the latest industrial revolution and the\ngrowing trend towards automation and data exchange where the focus is on the\nnetwork of machines which are interconnected to each other rather than on a\nsingle machine.\n\n**Industry 4.0 technologies and processes include:**\n\n  * **Internet Of Things**\n  * **Industrial Internet Of Things**\n  * **Cloud computing**\n  * **Big data**\n  * **Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning**\n  * **Smart factories**\n  * **Smart manufacturing**\n  * **Cognitive computing**\n  * **Cyber-Physical systems**\n\nIn this era, there are intelligent and smart factories where machines and\nsensors can communicate among themselves and hence analyze their operations\nand thus issues by means of underlying technologies like Internet Of Things\nand Big Data. Big data come up with solutions to store huge data sets\nefficiently to extract knowledge faster and simpler. Artificial intelligence\nand machine learning, when applied on this data, leads to smart manufacturing\nwhich enhances the quality of processes, generates predictive insights and\nthus minimizes risks and maximizes throughput.\n\nThese days, there are also talks about interconnected supply chains which\nenable industries to supply or exchange data about products or services to a\nconsumer, thereby building a better supply chain built on trust and\ntransparency.\n\nBy creating EdgeXY, we strive to make this happen easily for you, by helping\nyou control costs, improve efficiencies, enables business growth and meets up\nwith customer expectations. EdgeXY aims to extract value from Industry 4.0 as\nthey share the common goal of establishing the industry, employees, suppliers\nand consumers as an interconnected, integrated network linked to other\nnetworks around the world.\n\n## **Software for industry 4.0 evolving through technology**\n\n**EdgeXY is a platform which is safe and secure and envisioned for extracting,\naggregating, computing and sharing electronic data which allows every\nparticipant to extract, store, purchase, verify and run analytics on the data.\nEdgeXY allows the digitization of industry operations by providing tools that\naggregate, analyze and exchange data packages as:**\n\n**EA**\n\n**EC**\n\n****EE****\n\n**EDGEXY AGGREGATE (EA)** : This module focuses on extracting and aggregating\nrelevant information from chunks of data. EA module can transform and migrate\nhistoric data and use them to train predictive models. It can also receive and\nprocess live batch data and generate statistical insights based on it. EA is\ngenerally installed in a cloud or local machine to support Lab administrator\nor a Scientist.\n\n**EDGEXY COMPUTE (EC)** : This module helps to monitor and control a batch\ncycle, encoded into it as its batch protocol. EC module is installed on a\ntablet or mobile and is generally used by the technician to monitor and\ncontrol the production protocols. It has the means to read the relevant\nprocess data from the sensors.\n\n****EDGEXY EXCHANGE (EE)** : **This module provides a blockchain-based\nplatform, providing distributed trust, to exchange electronic data among your\nconsumers and suppliers. EE is adopted by the sales team to exchange\nelectronic data.\n\n## **Solutions: Thoughtfully Considering the Requirements**\n\n**EdgeXY is Simelabs\u2019s new digital venture which came to life, from our ample\nexperience with numerous pharmaceutical & banking clients. It involved working\non a wide range of technologies, designing and implementing new platforms and\nfinding solutions to the problems our clients have been facing. It evolved in\nthree phases:**\n\nThe first phase involved collecting relevant documents and extracting\nknowledge from them, often called intelligent data extraction or knowledge\nmining, which is done with Robotic Process Automation and Machine Learning\ntools. It also involves the semantic transformation of the data to key-value\nfields and our intelligent models provide you with meaning insights with self-\nexplanatory visualizations.\n\nThe second phase concentrated on analyzing the batch data and it involved\nstandardizing, monitoring and controlling batch processes. It also includes\nreading data from sensors in order to enrich live batch data and thus predict\nthe outcomes which help you minimize the product wastage.\n\nThe third phase conceptualizes a blockchain-based platform for data sharing,\nwhich by the inbuilt properties of the chain, by bearing the properties such\nas transparency, security, immutability, traceability and thus assures the\nauthenticity of the exchanged electronic data which in turn integrate your\ncompliance system with that of suppliers and consumers.\n\n**Throughout the process, EdgeXY focussed on establishing the most efficient\nand modern approach in finding the solutions. This is a journey where we\nreimagine the industrial world and the idea fulfilled by the help of\napplications like automation, big data,artificial intelligence, blockchain and\nmachine learning.**\n\n## **Outcomes**\n\n**EdgeXY acts as a stepping stone for the brave new world of the fourth\nindustrial revolution. This project has profoundly transformed the way our\nemployees think, work and hence access knowledge accordingly. We think it\nhelps you to increase the productivity of your factories and demonstrate\ninnovation thus making you remain competitive and growth-oriented.**\n\n## To discover more, click on the learn button below.\n\n**LEARN**\n\n## Technologies Used\n\nNext  __\n\n### Indventr\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Tools like GitHub Copilot leverage Gen AI\nto suggest code snippets in real time, enabling developers to write accurate\nand efficient code faster. Additionally, Gen AI models assist in code\nrefactoring by identifying optimization opportunities in existing codebases\nand recommending improvements, streamlining development processes.\n\n### **Intelligent CI/CD Pipelines**\n\nGen AI revolutionizes Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)\npipelines by enhancing efficiency and reliability. AI-driven error prediction\nanalyzes historical pipeline data to forecast build failures, allowing teams\nto implement preemptive fixes. Furthermore, dynamic resource allocation\npowered by Gen AI ensures optimal utilization of resources during build and\ndeployment processes, reducing costs and minimizing bottlenecks.\n\n### **Enhanced Incident Management**\n\nEffective incident management is crucial for maintaining operational\nstability, and Gen AI-powered systems elevate this capability. By analyzing\nsystem logs and behavior, AI models provide root cause analysis for faster\nproblem resolution. Additionally, self-healing mechanisms enable automated\nexecution of predefined scripts or workflows, ensuring minimal downtime\nwithout requiring manual intervention.\n\n### **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Optimization**\n\nManaging cloud resources becomes simpler and more accessible with Gen AI\u2019s\nability to interpret natural language commands. This capability allows non-\nexperts to configure and manage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) effortlessly,\nimproving the efficiency and scalability of infrastructure management while\nreducing errors.\n\n### **Improved Collaboration**\n\nCollaboration is the cornerstone of DevOps, and Gen AI fosters seamless\ncommunication and knowledge sharing across teams. AI-generated documentation\nensures smooth onboarding and acts as a centralized knowledge repository.\nAdditionally, Gen AI tools summarize meetings and conversations, ensuring that\nall stakeholders remain aligned, improving productivity and teamwork.\n\n* * *\n\n## Practical Applications of Gen AI in DevOps\n\n### **Predictive Monitoring**\n\nBy processing vast amounts of telemetry data, Gen AI models can forecast\npotential outages, enabling teams to take corrective actions before users are\naffected.\n\n### **Security Vulnerability Detection**\n\nGen AI scans code repositories for vulnerabilities, suggests fixes, and\ngenerates security reports, fortifying the DevOps pipeline.\n\n### **Custom Script and Workflow Generation**\n\nNatural language prompts allow DevOps engineers to quickly generate scripts\nfor tasks like log analysis, configuration updates, or system monitoring.\n\n* * *\n\n## Best Practices for Implementing Gen AI in DevOps\n\n1\\. **Start Small**\n\nWhen introducing Generative AI into DevOps, it\u2019s crucial to start with small,\nmanageable pilot projects.

Organisations need a variety of software platform to perform their\noperations and they need to select the best one and it is not an easy task. In\nrecent years, we have seen a rapid movement of software to cloud and the most\nwidely used form is SaaS(Service as a Software). SaaS platform offers a lot of\nbenefits and is cost-effective as you don't have to buy or build your own IT\ninfrastructure, install software, configure the application and maintain\neverything using an IT  department. Saas continues to have a grip on all\ncorners of the business world. But is SaaS a good idea for your company? Let's\nknow more about this.\n\n  \n\n## What is SaaS?\n\nSaaS (Service as a Software) allows us to access data from any device having\nan internet connection and a web browser. Now the users can connect to all\ncloud-based apps over the internet. It is one of the 3 major categories of\ncloud services. Since SaaS is easy to access, the SaaS model has become common\nfor many types of business applications. Application of SaaS involves email,\nsales management, financial management, human resource management, billing and\nso on. SaaS applications are integrated with other software using Application\nProgram Interfaces(APIs).\n\nThe rise of SaaS and the rise of cloud coincides with each other. Before SaaS\nwas available, in order to update software companies need to purchase the\ncompact disks containing these updates and download them in the system. For\nlarge organisations, they have high software requirements and installing and\nupdating software is a time-consuming task. Then software updates became\navailable through internet and organisations started buying licenses instead\nof disks. A copy of that software needs to be installed on all devices that\nneed to access it. By using SaaS the users can now log in through internet or\nweb browser and connect to that particular network where the service is\nprovided. So there is no need to install or update software. SaaS is easy to\nimplement, update, debug and is relatively cheap as companies now need to\nspend their money only on SaaS rather than spending their money on each and\nevery software licence for every computer.\n\n##  What is multi-tenancy?\n\nIt is an architecture where a single instance of software serves multiple\ntenants. Tenants are customers and each tenant shares the software application\nand the database but each tenant\u2019s data is isolated and hence the data owned\nby one tenant is not seen by any other tenants. Multi-tenancy is used by\nMicrosoft Azure and Amazon web services in cloud computing. It is a key part\nof another cloud model named SaaS (Service as a Software). It allows us to\nefficiently serve everyone from small customers to big enterprises.\nDevelopment and maintenance costs are shared and hence total expenditure is\nreduced and the resulting savings are passed onto the customers. Customers\nshould be given the ability to modify some parts of the application but not\nmodify the code related to the application. Before you set up a multi-tenant\napplication in your company, you should look into both their benefits and\nlimitations.\n\n## Benefits of Multi-tenant\n\nThere are many reasons for the growing demand for Multi-tenant applications.\nLet's see some of them\n\nCost Factor: Multi-tenant applications allows sharing of resources, databases\nand even applications. The investment cost is fixed and is shared by many of\nthe tenants and hence per-cost is very low. So now adding new customers won't\ncost you much. There is is no need to add any new hardware or applications in\nthe environment. Vendors of multi-tenant application benefit a lot from their\narchitecture as in a multi-tenant application we need to update and manage\nonly one central application and hence concentrate more on other important\ntasks.\n\nPerformance: Multi-tenancy for SaaS architecture is highly efficient as it\nbrings out the best in the cloud environment. Since most resources of the\napplication are shared, this type of SaaS architecture leverages speed,\nefficiency and reliability that SaaS can offer.\n\nUpdate and Maintenance: Latest version of the software, features and updates\nare always provided to you by the vendors. Users do not have to pay for this.\nIt\u2019s easy to maintain or upgrade technology or application as it is to be done\nonly at one centralised point and hence reflected at all other ends. The\nmaintenance cost for the upgrades are shared among all the tenants and hence\nper cost for each tenant remains a very small amount.\n\nOn-boarding new tenants: In a multitenant application, the environment remains\nthe same for every customer. Hence it's easier to add new customers without\nany efforts or money and provides a smooth experience.\n\nScalability: It is easy to scale a multitenant system when compared to a\nsingle-tenant system.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/tag/iot-hub/", "title": "Iot Hub Archives - Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Iot Hub\n\n##  How Digital Twins Can Revolutionize Autonomous Operations in Manufacturing\n\nMay 7, 2023 6:38 pm\n\nIndustry 4.0 was introduced almost a decade ago, and many manufacturers have\nsince launched pilots\n\n##  Digital Twin for West Pharma\n\nNovember 9, 2022 9:21 am\n\nImplemented for Monitoring & Maintenance of Machines in AR / VR Environment.\nDigital Twin is\n\n##  Stellapps\n\nApril 8, 2020 1:38 pm\n\nDigitization is playing an important role in the business world.

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Let us learn about the factors that help in ranking a website better in SERP. Tap the link to know more.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Exploring ranking factors for SEO\n\nSearch engine and Google ranking algorithms are constantly on the move. Recent\ntimes have shown that even the most traditional businesses shifting to a\nthought process that they needed to accelerate the shift to digital as\nconsumers shifted en masse to the internet. This is where SEO becomes an\nintegral part of branding and ranking your website appropriately. The most\nviable and cost-effective method of comprehending and reaching customers at\ncritical times is through SEO. Many brands and businesses are aware (or\nbelieve they are aware) of the importance of SEO for their digital properties,\nas well as the benefits of outsourcing SEO. It's critical to stay current on\nthe latest ranking factors and to run an SEO audit tool on your site on a\nregular basis to ensure that you're following the most current SEO best\npractices.\n\nThere are over 200 SEO ranking factors that assist search engines in\ndetermining which sites should appear in search results and how they should\nrank. You must optimise your online presence to cater to these factors if you\nwant to claim the top spots on SERPs (search engine results pages).\n\nThe good news is that not all of the ranking factors, which number in the\nhundreds, are created equal. While some ranking factors are more important\nthan others, pay special attention to these 10 factors that have the greatest\nimpact on rankings as you plan your SEO strategy.\n\n  1. **Site Security**\n\nHTTPS encryption shows search engines that a site is secure, which helps them\ndirect users to the most trustworthy sites. If your website's URL starts with\nHTTP rather than HTTPS, it is not secure and requires an SSL certificate.\n\n  2. **Crawlability**\n\nSearch engines can\u2019t rank a site if they can\u2019t find it. That's why site\ncrawlability is such a crucial ranking factor in SEO. Crawlability is the\nability for search engines to crawl a website and review its content in order\nto determine what the page is about and how it should rank.\n\n  3. **Mobile-Friendliness**\n\nThe term \"mobile-friendliness\" refers to how a website appears and functions\nwhen viewed on a mobile device. Mobile-friendly websites offer a positive user\nexperience by employing a responsive design that adjusts the content to fit\nany screen size. Mobile-friendliness is important to both search engines and\nusers because more searches are conducted on mobile devices than on desktops\n(52.2 percent of internet traffic comes from mobile devices, and the number is\ngrowing).\n\n  4. **Page Load Speed**\n\nPage load speed is another SEO ranking factor that has to do with user\nexperience. Sites that take a long time to load provide a poor user\nexperience. Because search engines understand that people want answers as soon\nas possible, they prefer to display sites that load quickly. This is\nespecially true for mobile sites, as Google recently announced that load speed\nwould be a ranking factor for mobile searches as part of its Speed Update.\n\n  5. **High-Quality Content**\n\nFresh content attracts search crawlers and improves search visibility while\nalso providing you with something useful to share with your audience, making\nit a win-win situation for your marketing efforts.\n\n  6. **The Right Target Keywords**\n\nPerform keyword research to determine which keywords to target and topics to\ncover when creating content. The process of identifying popular keywords that\ncan drive traffic to your website is known as keyword research.\n\n  7. **Structured Data**\n\nBecause it clearly tells search engines what is important about a page,\nstructured data is a top SEO ranking factor. Structured data is also important\nbecause it can lead to featured snippets in search, which can increase click-\nthrough rates and rankings even more.\n\n  8. **Domain Factors**\n\nThe age of your domain, or how old your website is, is frequently used as a\nranking factor. While Google does not explicitly state that age is a ranking\nfactor, research has shown that older domains rank higher. This clearly\nindicates that new websites with new domains take time to rank higher in the\nsearch engines. Your site's search ranking will improve over time with\nconsistent SEO work, but it won't happen overnight.\n\n  9. **Page-Level Factors**\n\nWhile this is a much-discussed topic when it comes to On-Page SEO, the major\nportion of its attributes goes to the famous Google Hummingbird update. The\nupdate has grown to such an extent that, Google is equipped enough to\nunderstand a topic of the content and crawl accordingly. Furthermore, the\nGoogle Caffeine update also comes in alignment with this particular notion of\nSEO and helps in effectively favouring updated content, particularly for time-\nsensitive searches.\n\n  10. **Backlink Factors**\n\nBacklinks are another signal that a website is credible and authoritative to\nsearch engines. Off-page SEO factors such as the number and quality of links\npointing to your site have a significant impact on your search rankings.\n\nBacklinks are frequently regarded as the second most important SEO ranking\nfactor after content. If you want your site to rank, you'll need a strategy\nfor acquiring high-quality backlinks, such as guest posting, link acquisition,\ndigital PR, and other link-building tactics.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/biometrics-transforming-for-the-era-with-mobile-banking/", "title": "Biometric Transformation for the Era with Mobile Banking - Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "t\u2019s understand how biometric authentication in mobile is revolutionizing the current banking and financial services and the industry.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Biometric Transformation for the Era with Mobile Banking\n\nLet\u2019s understand how **biometric authentication in mobile** is revolutionizing\nthe current banking and financial services and the industry.\n\n\u201cBiometrics\u201d has been a buzzword on trend these days and this mechanism has an\ninflux of pilot schemes that have confirmed that biometric revolution is no\nlonger a distant fantasy, but rather a pressing reality through biometric\nauthentication in mobiles. The biometric smart card is approaching its\ninflection point after a number of successful trials using fingerprint sensor\ntechnology within smart cards across multiple markets (including Bulgaria, the\nUnited States, Mexico, Cyprus, Japan, the Middle East, and South Africa). Key\nplayers in the banking industry such as Visa and Mastercard believe that\nbiometrics are expected to play a key role in the payments revolution. As a\nresult, many financial institutions are upgrading their mobile authentication\nstrategy and investigating biometrics as a replacement for PIN/passwords, and\neven digitally signing sensitive transactions. They understand that this\nimproves the user experience for everyday banking operations.\n\n#### **How Accurate Is It?**\n\nBiometric technology has been used by law enforcement agencies and governments\nfor accurate identification for many years, and it has proven to be extremely\neffective in tracking data. By ensuring that the right person has access to\nthe right information, biometric password management improves authentication\naccuracy. Biometric technology, on the other hand, does not always work.\nEyeprint ID won't work if you can't hold your mobile device still enough for\nthe scanner, and some iris scanners won't work with coloured contacts.\n\n#### **Using Biometrics In Mobile Banking**\n\nStrong mobile banking infrastructures are built on the foundation of the\nhighest levels of digital security, and the use of biometric technology has\nonly accelerated that process. Iris scans, which incorporate critical aspects\nof biometric identification systems such as facial recognition, voice\nrecognition, and fingerprint scans, are quickly becoming the go-to security\nstandards around the world. This has led to a popular belief that biometrics\nwill soon completely replace PINs, making them outdated. According to\nresearch, 56 percent of consumers trust biometric techniques to verify\ntransactions, and the market is expected to reach $24.59 billion by 2023.\n\nThe days of password-protected transactions at counters will soon be a thing\nof the past. According to the Indian Institute of Management, 82% of Indians\ndecide whether or not to use mobile banking apps based on the technology's\nease of use and ability to protect users' privacy. Furthermore, the smartphone\nhas changed the biometrics market in mobile banking. Smartphone cameras,\nfingerprint sensors, and microphones now allow users to capture their own\nfacial, fingerprint, and voice characteristics using their own hardware,\npaving the way for \"multi-factor\" biometrics. The digitally empowered banking\ncustomer has leveled up once again with mobile biometrics. Mobile biometrics\nhas added a new dimension to mobile banking, from reduced fraud and faster\ntransactions to increased accuracy and authentication. Biometrics technologies\nhave the advantage of being organically integrated at various stages of a\ncustomer's interaction with your product \u2013 for example, to access the banking\napp, validate a payment, confirm a sensitive account action, and so on. After\nall, the most common form of behavioural biometrics, such as a finger scan, is\nfar more practical than any custom PIN. Biometrics, along with other cutting-\nedge approaches to cyber security, can help strike a balance between the need\nfor increased security and the desire for convenience. For example, HSBC was\none of the first banks in the UK to support Voice IDs and Touch IDs for\ncustomer authentication when customers wanted to access some banking services\nthrough the phone or maybe log into the mobile banking app for different\npurposes. It's safe to say that biometric technology will be the next big\nthing in finance, embraced across all industries.\n\nBiometric Authentication\n\nSingle-factor authentication and multi-factor authentication are the most\ncommon authentication schemes used in mobile banking.\n\nSingle-factor authentication\n\nThe use of authentication credentials, such as a user name and password, is\nreferred to as single-factor authentication. The disadvantage of this scheme\nis that using various algorithms, passwords can be easily guessed and stolen.\n\nMulti-factor authentication\n\nMulti-factor authentication relies on a combination of two factors: something\nyou own and something you know. It entails the use of two factors: static\npasswords and one-time passwords generated by small devices. This scheme,\nwhile providing a higher level of security than single-factor authentication,\nis unreliable. Unauthorized access to mobile devices is always a possibility,\nso OTPs can be easily stolen.\n\nGiven the flaws of single-factor and multi-factor authentication schemes, it\nis concluded that more secure authentication mechanisms should be implemented\nin mobile banking. In this case, a review of various biometric techniques is\nrequired in order to select the best one for use in the authentication system.\n\n#### **Forging through biometrics in mobile banking**\n\nBiometric identification technology is difficult, if not impossible, to forge,\nwhich means that the banking and financial services industry can drastically\nreduce or even eliminate losses caused by customer identity theft and fraud by\nusing biometrics.

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Flutter and React Native are frameworks that allow you to develop applications which run seamlessly across multiple platforms.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Flutter vs React native- The Ultimate Face-off\n\nMobile applications have a pivotal role in the success of any company and\nhence have become an inseparable part of the business. In the past, companies\nstruggled to develop applications for multiple platforms with different\ntechnologies and different teams. Since the dream of every company is to\nrelease its application in both Play Store as well as AppStore faster and\nusing a single language, cross platforms are gaining popularity over time. In\n2020 the major market players among the cross-platform applications which\ninclude Flutter and React native are creating a spark in the digital world.\nBoth of the applications have their limitations and merits which makes them\nequally apt for their use in 2020. In this article, we will compare and\ncontrast the features of both Flutter and React Native which will help you to\ndecide the best framework for your application.\n\n## What is React Native and Flutter?\n\nReact native is a javascript framework founded by Facebook, which is used for\ndeveloping natively rendered applications for both ios and android. It was\nreleased in 2015 and it enables developers to use react and other native\nplatform capabilities.\n\nOn the other hand, Flutter released in 2017 is relatively young when compared\nto React Native. Flutter is a portable UI software development kit created by\nGoogle for creating applications for mobile, web and desktop using the same\ncodebase.\n\n**We will compare them using the following criteria:**\n\n  * **Language**\n  * **Popularity**\n  * **User Interface**\n  * **Productivity and Support**\n  * **Learning curve**\n  * **Performance**\n  * **Talent Hiring**\n\n## Language:\n\nReact Native uses light-weighted, just in time compiled programming language\ncalled Javascript to build applications. Javascript is the most prevailing\nlanguage with high popularity which makes them one of the most used languages\nin the world. There are indeed too many javascript developers and for any\njavascript developer, React Native is quite easy to learn.\n\nFlutter is written in a fast, object-oriented programming language developed\nby google called Dart. It is easy to learn and rarely used language with\nC-style syntax whose popularity remains less when compared to Javascript.\n\n## Popularity:\n\nAccording to stack overflow, react native is the most trending language as it\nhas been in the market for more years than flutter. On the other hand, flutter\nhas turned out to be a more loved framework than react native and since it is\ngaining fame within a few years, it has got better chances of being the most\npopular in the future. React Native and Flutter are backed by major\ncorporations Facebook and Google, who heavily invested in these frameworks\nmaking them the best solutions to build cross-platform applications.\n\n## User Interface:\n\nIn case of React Native, it provides just UI rendering but in order to make an\ninteractive and sophisticated user interface, additional support of the third-\nparty libraries are inevitable. This makes the React Native highly dependent\non the third-party libraries. Flutter consists of widgets- material design\nwidgets and Cupertino widgets packed inside itself which makes them completely\nindependent of third-party libraries. Flutter apps will remain consistent in\nterms of looks and functionality in every platform.\n\n## Productivity and Support:\n\nHot reloading is a feature that allows the developers to view all the changes\nmade them in real-time on the screen without losing the state of the app. Both\nreact native and flutter provides this feature to enhance the efficiency of\nthe developer.\n\nIn case of react native, developers can use any ide or text editor. If\ndevelopers find any difficulties in the middle of a project, they can get\nenough support as Javascript is known among a number of developers. In the\ncase of flutter, the dart is a very rarely used programming language and hence\ncannot use in many ides and text editors. Even if developers find any\ndifficulties in the middle of a project, they can\u2019t get enough support as Dart\nis not known among most of the developers and hence its community of\ndevelopers is much less when compared to that of react-native.\n\n## Learning Curve:\n\nAccording to the developers, React Native is much easier to learn and debug\nthan any other languages. This is because Javascript has been in the market\nand known to developers for a very long period of time.  In the case of\nflutter, it demands a little more effort to attain knowledge about the\nplatform as Dart is a new language with a very small community of developers.\n\n## Performance:\n\nIn the case of performance, Flutter is better and faster when compared to\nReact Native. Flutter consists of C/C++ library which is closely related to\nmachine learning and renders better native performance, handles many of the\nissues by itself and provides better UI experience. React Native consists of\njavascript bridge which helps it to interact with native components to extend\nits performance. Flutter does not need to add any additional components to\nmaintain its performance faster and smoother.\n\n## Talent hiring:\n\nReact native developers have greater job opportunities than that of Flutter\ndevelopers as React native has been around for a couple of years more than the\nflutter. Moreover react native developers are also React developers and since\nReact is the most popular front end framework, job opportunities gradually\nincrease. But we cant come to the conclusion that flutter will have less\ndemand as it is a newbie and with some years of experience its demand might\nrise.\n\n## Popular apps using React Native\n\n### Instagram\n\n### Facebook\n\n### Pinterest\n\n### Skype\n\n### Wix\n\n### Walmart\n\n## Popular apps using Flutter\n\n### Google Ads\n\n### Reflectly\n\n### Alibaba\n\n### Hamilton\n\n### Birch Finance\n\n### Coach Yourself\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nFinally, in the battle between flutter and react-native, there is neither a\nwinner nor a loser. Both of them have equal merits and demerits. It all\ndepends on personal choice. If the developer is familiar or an expert in\njavascript, then react-native becomes a great choice. It has got greater\ncommunity support and experienced developers. If the developer is familiar\nwith java, c++ or other object-oriented paradigms, then Flutter becomes a\ngreat choice. It provides a better UI experience for your applications. Both\nare strong competitors and provides the best solution as cross-platform\napplications.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

The rate of digitisation has accelerated in the last 50 years,\nespecially with the arrival of computers in the workplace. We used to have to\nuse a modem to connect to the network, fax clients, or floppy discs to\ntransfer data.\n\nThe significant improvements in workplace technology nowadays are less about\noffice mobility and more about providing the greatest possible work\nenvironment, where administrative hours are cut, employee welfare is\nprioritised, and monetary and environmental expenses are decreased. Smart\ndevices and systems are at the heart of this business transformation, but IoT\nsecurity should be a top priority when getting started.\n\nWith data breaches and GDPR fines at an all-time high, bringing additional\ngadgets into the office that consume large amounts of data must be considered\nseriously. However, recognising the advantages of the Internet of Things to a\nbusiness may help organisations make educated decisions about whether or not\nto employ this technology.\n\nSo, let's take a closer look at how IoT affects the workplace:  \n  \n**1\\. Know where everything is, all the time**\n\nThe Internet of Things has the potential to make office life and corporate\nprocedures far more productive and efficient. One important way the Internet\nof Things can boost productivity and efficiency is by making location\nmonitoring easier and more seamless. Internet-connected equipment and gadgets\nwill all be spatially marked, similar to how it is done in hospitals, saving\nworkers time and money by lowering the loss rate.  \n  \n**2\\. Managing assets**\n\nIt's an understatement to say you have a lot on your plate. It's difficult to\nkeep track of everything from building systems and hardware to office\nfurniture and varied technology in today's hybrid workplace. The Internet of\nThings allows you to keep track of everything and obtain real-time data on how\neach asset is functioning. The potential to use the Internet of Things for\npredictive maintenance is one of its biggest advantages.\n\nPreventive maintenance is likely already in use to keep building systems and\nequipment from generating larger, more expensive issues. Predictive\nmaintenance takes this a step further by utilising the power of IoT sensors to\ndetect the exact state of each asset. To avoid unexpected failures, you can\npredict when problems are most likely to occur.  \n  \n**3\\. Digital Assistants-**\n\nDigital assistants are one of the most well-known IoT applications, which many\npeople utilise in their homes nowadays. Even chatbots are becoming\nincreasingly popular in supporting employees with their jobs and inquiries.\nHowever, these gadgets are not widely used in the workplace. The most obvious\napplication of a digital assistant in the workplace is to assist employees\nwith their individual tasks and phone calls. Regardless, they possess far\ngreater potential. Digital assistants can help you with controlling the\nconference room equipment settings and purchase supplies, it also lets you\nknow which meeting rooms are free, update your calendar, set up meetings, and\nmany more.  \n  \n**4\\. Smart desks**\n\nEmployers are estimated to spend about $1 billion every week addressing the\nimpacts of poor workplace ergonomics, such as terrible posture, heavy lifting,\nand burnout, according to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n(OSHA). While many firms already have policies in place to educate their\nemployees, the Internet of Things may also be utilised to assist avoid these\nissues by giving real-time statistics on employee health and welfare.\n\nSmart desks, for example, can inform you if you've been sitting for too long,\nand smart chairs contain sensors that can detect poor posture and provide\nsuggestions for adjustment. Furthermore, wellness wearables may be provided to\nemployees to remind them to take a walk, alter their computer's light\nsettings, or even drink a glass of water. Using up-to-date analytics in this\nway can assist employees improve their working environment by enhancing\nconcentration and helping them be more productive.\n\nWe are only at the beginning of the curve for smart devices in the office,\nwith the smart office market expected to be worth $57 billion by 2025.\nEmployees and enterprises may use innovative IoT solutions to make better\njudgments regarding their daily activities and long-term operations. These\ntechnologies can not only help employees become more efficient, but they can\nalso help organisations save money and the environment.  \n  \n**5\\. Increased device management complexity**\n\nThe complexity of managing connected devices develops in lockstep with the\nquantity of linked devices. Today's workforce, for example, uses smartphones\nfor communication, productivity, and entertainment. They will have a new\npurpose with IoT: controlling IoT-connected devices. Many IoT-connected\ndevices in the future will lack a display. Smartphones will be the primary\nmeans of controlling the gadget. The multiplicity of operating systems will\nfurther add to the difficulty. As a result, staff and IT departments will have\nto deal with a wider range of platforms than simply Android and iOS.\n\nEmployees may need the training to understand how to operate and manage\nlinked, cross-platform devices in each of these cases.\n\n**Changes in IoT implementation in the office**\n\nThe first barrier arises when businesses anticipate that a new environment\nwould necessitate high-cost expenditures. Pilot versions or minor IoT\ninfrastructure integrations might help you avoid unnecessary costs from the\nstart. The long-term goals need tiny, solid efforts to attain a global vision.\n\nSecond, the threat of data leaks might exacerbate the problem. As a result,\nthe many parts of IoT security evaluations can aid in the development of\nincreased security measures for IoT systems.\n\nThird, despite the infancy of IoT standards, firms may face these difficulties\nwhen they construct their strategic plans. The manufacturing process can be\nfine-tuned after the possible system failures are considered, as we already\nknow.\n\nIt is up to you to determine whether or not to implement an IoT system in your\noffice. When it comes to the most important advantages, however, the wonderful\noffices of the future are the best option. The benefits cover a wide range of\noffice requirements, and this choice might be a huge step forward in the\nworkplace's future.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe usage of sensors in the home and at work is only expected to grow in the\nfuture. This will make it easy to track almost everything that happens in the\noffice. This will improve office infrastructure efficiency, but it may also\npresent new challenges: employees may not enjoy being monitored by their smart\ndesks, IoT employee badges, or other systems, and managers will need to be\ncautious about how the data is generated by these systems are utilised.\n\nLooking ahead, one possible area of growth is the integration of wearable\ngadgets with the smart office: it's not hard to envisage a wristwatch being\nable to unlock the door to your workplace and log you onto our PC. However,\nthese gadgets have a variety of additional sensors that may be beneficial; for\nexample, if everyone's pulse rate began to rise when dealing with a\nparticularly unpleasant boss, HR could receive an alarm.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Learn about how the blockchain technology is helping the healthcare industry in various ways. Tap the link to know more.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Blockchain and healthcare\n\nIn the field of medical technology, \"blockchain\" is one of the most prominent\nbuzzwords. This has a suitable alternative. Interoperability, privacy, and\nsupply chain traceability were all major challenges in the healthcare and life\nsciences sectors even before the development of COVID-19. Another big issue is\nthat private electronic health record systems from over 700 different\nsuppliers sometimes do not communicate with one another. In 2018, we witnessed\n1,750 medicine counterfeiting occurrences in the United States alone.\n\nPatients may be properly focused on at the heart of all operations once it is\nfully deployed, which will be completely revamped with improved security,\nprivacy, and accessibility. The major question does not end there. How is the\nhealthcare business using the potential of this cutting-edge technology?\n\nThe medical industry has been adversely affected by the inability to securely\nshare and access sensitive patient data. For genuine interoperability,\nhowever, blockchain will enable highly configurable openness while preserving\nonly the highest security requirements. As a result, health information\nsystems will be able to collaborate inside and beyond organisational\nboundaries to improve the delivery of healthcare to individuals and\ncommunities.\n\nFor example, Chronicled's MediLedger Network uses blockchain technology to\nconnect trading partners and medical institutions closer together than ever\nbefore. Without the continual threat of communication and organisational\nbreakdowns, there is now considerably more freedom for innovation and\nindustrial development. Blockchain provides a new world of trust and\ncooperation, from the automation of once-hectic operations to increased\nresponsibility from all stakeholders.\n\n  * Patient-centric electronic health records\n\nData silos are a problem in every nation and region, which means that patients\nand their healthcare providers have an incomplete view of their medical\nhistory. Medical mistakes arising from poorly coordinated treatment, such as\nplanned actions not executed as intended or errors of omission inpatient\nrecords, were the third greatest cause of mortality in the United States in\n2016, according to study released by Johns Hopkins University.\n\n  * Medical staff credential verification\n\nBlockchain technology can be used to track the experience of medical\nprofessionals in the same way that it can be used to track the provenance of a\nmedical good. Trusted medical institutions and healthcare organisations can\nlog the credentials of their staff, which helps to streamline the hiring\nprocess for healthcare organisations. ProCredEx, located in the United States,\nhas created a medical credential verification system based on the R3 Corda\nblockchain technology.\n\nMajor advantages of blockchain system :\n\n  1. During the staffing process, healthcare organisations will be able to get credentialed more quickly.\n  2. A potential for medical institutions, insurers, and healthcare providers to earn from their present and prior employee credentials data.\n  3. Transparency and assurance for partners, such as organisations that subcontract locum tenens or in new virtual health care models to tell patients about medical staff experience.\n\n  *  IoT security for remote monitoring\n\nOne of the most significant developments in digital health is the use of\nremote monitoring systems, in which all types of sensors that detect patients'\nvital signs are used to potentially give healthcare practitioners better\nvisibility into patients' health, enabling more proactive and preventative\ncare. Many intriguing remote monitoring use cases were already explored in our\narticles on 5G and edge computing in digital health.\n\nHowever, patient data security is a big worry in health IoT, both in terms of\nkeeping it private and secure and preventing it from being manipulated to\nproduce false results. In some scenarios, when a connected device may be\nrelied on in an emergency situation, such as informing an elderly person's\ncaregiver that they have fallen or had a heart attack, it is equally critical\nthat the supporting systems are highly robust to DDoS or other assaults\ninterrupting service.\n\nHow blockchain technology might aid in the safe monitoring of IoT devices in\nthe field:\n\nPersonal information is recorded as a unique hash function on the blockchain,\nand blockchain cryptography ensures that only authorized parties have access\nto it (any change in the source data will create a different hash function,\nand a user must have a specific set of cryptographic keys to decode the hash\nfunction into the source data).\n\nIt's practically hard to tamper with patient data after it's recorded on the\nblockchain ledger (as a hash function), because doing so would necessitate\nhaving access to all stored copies.\n\nBecause of the decentralized nature of blockchain, IoT devices may interact\ndirectly with each other instead of going through a centralized server (like\nmost IoT connections do today), making DDoS and man-in-the-middle attacks\nextremely difficult.\n\n  * Permissed Blockchains and Smart Contracts\n\nA Permissioned Blockchain keeps data private while making it accessible to\nactors on the network who have been granted access. Smart Contracts are\nblockchain 'instructions' that are automatically executed whenever all of the\nappropriate circumstances or events are satisfied. This implies that data may\nbe made available without the need for human interaction.\n\n### **Case Studies**\n\nHashed Health leverages blockchain to provide a free and open forum for health\ncare professionals to debate and collaborate in an effort to learn more about\nblockchain's applications in the sector. The firm also has an advising\ndivision that assists healthcare businesses in understanding how blockchain\nmight be incorporated into current systems.

It's a\ntechnique for standing out from the crowd by explaining exactly what you have\nto offer that makes you the superior option. The brand of your company is\ndesigned to accurately reflect who you are and how you want to be seen.\nBranding has the capacity to change people's impressions of your firm, create\nnew business, and increase brand value - but if done properly or not at all,\nit may also have the opposite impact. Any firm needs to perform thorough\nmarket research to identify why shoppers should be drawn to your company in\norder to establish a successful brand. If you have a strong brand, customers\nwill remember you and be more sure that your products or services will suit\ntheir needs. Customers are more inclined to remain with a brand they are\nfamiliar with and trust.\n\nThe average customer is exposed to up to 10,000 marketing messages every day,\naccording to studies. To get through the clutter, a brand image should be\nstrong and direct, like an elevator pitch\u2014a succinct and accurate statement of\nyour core beliefs, unique benefits, and mission. It's never been simple to\ndeliver it well, especially if you deal with tech businesses, which are\nnotoriously difficult to express clearly.\n\nThe tech business is known for dealing with more severe everyday influences\nthan other industries. Overnight obsolescence, lightning-fast innovation,\nminimal barriers to entrepreneurs and disruptors, continual change. It's a\ntumultuous world out there, but all of these elements may work in your favour\nif you have a strong and active brand. Firms should stand out above the crowd,\nexplain their capabilities, and secure consumer loyalty, from IT companies to\nSAAS brands and everything in between.\n\nLet's take a look at some of the most effective technology branding methods\navailable. Microsoft, Google, and AT&T are among the top 25 \"world's largest\ntechnological brands.\" They each put a lot of effort into their branding,\nwhich they employ to bring together a variety of dissimilar services into a\ncohesive family while also conveying a strong emotional undertone that\nattracts people in.There are numerous characteristics of the example they set\nthat we might emphasise, but there is one secret that they all share: their\nbrand promise is unmistakably clear.\n\nA brand promise is one or two essential principles that describe your\nfundamental value proposition and summarize why buyers pick your brand.\n\n  * The goal for Google is to organize the world's knowledge in a way that is both helpful and accessible.\n  * It is the mission of Microsoft Business to enable organizations to benefit from a constantly evolving world of digital technology.\n  * It's all about perfecting the client experience and pleasure for AT&T.\n\nA brand promise must represent a simple, straightforward concept that is easy\nto understand. Making your own vow, on the other hand, is usually more\ndifficult than it looks. It's usually tough to focus on the one real notion\nthat successfully distils your identity into a few words \u2014 the core, unifying,\nemotionally-resonant promise that's powerful enough, vital enough, and\nauthentic enough to serve as a long-term basis for your brand.\n\n### **How to approach branding in a tech company?**\n\nPrior to implementing digital branding initiatives, you must first complete\nthe following tasks:\n\n  * Goals. Define your objective, the items or services you provide, and who your target market is.\n  * Corporate identity guide. It is usual practise to have one, therefore if this is not the case for you, we recommend that you draw one up as soon as feasible. Having a guide will assist you in establishing a standard for all of your graphic communications.\n  * Brand personality. You must generate content and modify the tone of your communications depending on the audience you're addressing: approachable, cheerful, compassionate, crazy, serious\u2026 To avoid jeopardizing consistency, all of this must fit together nicely.\n  * Be honest. This should go without saying, yet certain brands are prone to overlook it. Something isn't functioning if your communication doesn't match the customer's experience with your product or service because it isn't up to par. Provide the finest user experience possible, don't forget about customer service, answer any issues that may arise, and apologize if something goes wrong. Remember how we discussed the need of humanizing your brand just a few moments ago?\n  * Take care of your employees. The finest potential branding you can put in place is having happy staff. They'll work harder, share your objectives, and be the first to spread the news about your company wherever they go.\n  * Reinvent yourself. Brands, in general, cannot remain static, let alone in the digital world, where constant evolution is required. You must keep an eye out for new trends and adjust your communication, channels, and so on. Build a solid foundation for your business and provide value to your products or services. This is the finest internet branding strategy you can use.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe silver lining for technology companies is the undervaluation of branding.\nIt implies you may get an advantage over your competition by defining yours.\nIn that spirit, it's always a good idea to take a brief break from the lemming\nrush and think about what you do and why you do it (vision). Determine what\nmakes your products stand out from the crowd, a trait that no one else has\n(USP). Determine why your consumers are concerned, and then consider who you\nare as a result (brand story). Your brand promise will emerge from these\nexercises.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Transformation processes by which organizations use new digital technologies to improve and reevaluate themselves to meet their business requirements.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Executing Digital Transformation\n\nCustomers are the most critical stakeholder in every business venture. In this\npacing world of technology, customers expect more from organisations and\nequipping these services and coping up with their changing desires and tastes\nis a challenge for all the organisations. The famous Charles Darwin quoted the\nbasic survival of species where neither the strongest nor most important\nspecies survives but the one who is most adaptable to changes will survive.\nThis article will provide key pieces of information about digital\ntransformation.\n\n## **What is Digital Transformation?**\n\nDigital transformation is a process by which organizations use new digital\ntechnologies to improve and reevaluate themselves to meet the varying business\nrequirements. Organizations revisit everything they do internally and conduct\nother interactive sessions with customers, thus creating a new way of getting\nbusiness done. Digital transformation is all about customers and how\norganizations aim at engaging the customers with their new technologies and\nmaking their organization much stronger than it was.\n\n  An important element of digital transformation is technology. We should know\nwhat digital transformation is really capable of and how we can mould the\nbusiness to adopt these changes efficiently.\n\nMoreover, companies adapt business tactics to succeed in digital\ntransformation. This has brought more importance to customer services. It\nremoves the traditional way of customers approaching the companies and has\nbrought more classic way where customers get to choose which company they\nwould like to put their trust on. Companies try to display their talent and\nabilities via advertisements and social media has played a sophisticated role\nin this.\n\n## **Transformations are hard, Digital ones are harder!**\n\nThe word \u2018digital transformation\u2019 is always dealt with uncertainty. Different\ncompanies have their own perspective towards digital transformation and thus\nthey adopt different strategies. As for many companies follow the trend and\ntry to bring out the concept just to keep up in the competition and achieve\nbenefits, they find success baffling. The success rate of digital\ntransformation is found to be very low. Still, many companies look forward to\nthis. In order to avoid the downfall companies should look into the factors\nthat may have a serious impact on their business.\n\nNow we look into the levels of execution of digital transformation and factors\nthat have an influence on the execution of the digital transformation.\n\n##  **Levels of** **Execution**\n\n**We have 3 levels of execution**\n\n> Strategic  \n> Program  \n> Application\n\nThe strategic level is considered as the first level of execution of digital\ntransformation where the companies create strategies to implement digital\ntransformation. They evaluate themselves so that they have a better idea about\nthe effect of digital transformation on their company and also discuss the\nrisks they are going to face in the future. There are many factors that play\nan important role at this level. First of all, all plans require a great\nleader combined with energy enthusiasm and lots of vision for the future to\nmanage and implement everything. Then secondly companies have to analyze the\nabove strategies and vision and their effect on the organisation and thus\nimplement the right strategies. A company that builds lots of applications\nwould never succeed in the field of digital transformation. What you really\nneed is a mixture of apps that let you run the business efficiently, ensure\nthat they meet customer\u2019s needs and could take up new business parallel to the\nexisting one and manage them efficiently.\n\nIn the case of digital transformation companies mainly concentrate on\nstrategies rather than practical execution. It is important for companies to\ngo beyond the strategic level and put a greater effort into implementing it.\nIt deals with more of an architectural or programmatic approach where\ncompanies mainly focus on how much budget is to be allocated, how to achieve\nbenefits and prove the return on investments and thus impart throughout the\norganisation. Now we would discuss the factors that play an important role in\nthis level. First of all, we need a project owner who has the right to take up\nthe strategies and vision to another level and thus make things work in place.\nThen we need is someone who can relate both business and industrial aspects\nand thus form a bridge between them. We call them architects and they look\ninto most of the technical aspects and ensure that it happens in an efficient\nmanner. Finally, we need to analyse the budget required and the return on\ninvestment.\n\nWe have already dealt with strategies and allocating budgets. Next level deals\nwith a practical approach where work really happens. It acts as a bridge\nbetween business and information technology. It involves making the most\nappropriate apps for the organisation in-order to flourish the business and\nchoosing the right skilled people for making them, which forms the team. One\nof the important factors in this level is the product owner, he is the one who\nmanages all technical aspects and checks on the whole team so that they work\non time and efficiently.\n\nIn all these levels we find that even though technology plays an important\nrole, your people are the most important assets. They play the most important\nroles in every level of execution of the digital transformation. They will\nultimately determine success or failure in your company. People are the ones\nwho should be able to adapt to the corresponding changes and manage and work\naccordingly.\n\nInorder to succeed in digital transformation, companies should ensure that\npeople and processes get along with each other.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/tag/edge-computing/", "title": "Edge Computing Archives - Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Edge Computing\n\n##  How is Intelligent Connectivity Shaping the Future of Digital\nTransformation?\n\nMarch 3, 2025 9:10 am\n\nTechnology is no longer working in silos; instead, it is converging to create\na more\n\n##  Top IT Services Trends for 2025: What Businesses Need to Know\n\nFebruary 5, 2025 6:49 am\n\nAs we step into 2025, the IT services landscape continues to evolve at an\nunprecedented\n\n##  How Digital Twins Can Revolutionize Autonomous Operations in Manufacturing\n\nMay 7, 2023 6:38 pm\n\nIndustry 4.0 was introduced almost a decade ago, and many manufacturers have\nsince launched pilots\n\n##  Digital Twin for West Pharma\n\nNovember 9, 2022 9:21 am\n\nImplemented for Monitoring & Maintenance of Machines in AR / VR Environment.\nDigital Twin is\n\n##  IoT in Smart Manufacturing\n\nFebruary 18, 2022 9:22 am\n\nLearn how smart manufacturing is opening doors for larger possibilities in\nbusiness and technology.

Transactional data, demographic\ndata, and virtually unlimited behavioural data are all available. When you add\nit all up, you've got data on everything from anonymous ad impressions to\nknown customer purchases, product usage, and customer service. Customer data\nis a subset of all of this information. This data is typically stored in\nsilos, whether organisational or technological, making it difficult for\nbusinesses to deliver consistent customer experiences across multiple channels\nand consumer devices.\n\nThe issues that have drawn marketers to the CDP are real, and the benefits of\nsolving them are substantial. However, marketing technology analysts are\nincreasingly convinced that these capabilities do not meet enough of a\nmarketer's objectives for the CDP to remain a stand-alone technology solution.\nMany people believe that CDPs will simply become standard components of large\nenterprise marketing solution suites like multichannel marketing hubs or real-\ntime interaction engines. It is critical that businesses carefully consider\ntheir CDP options. Marketers must first determine what the CDP solution under\nconsideration truly offers, as well as how many of their specific needs will\nbe met today and in the future.\n\n### **Customer data platform :More than a middleware  **\n\nA Customer Data Platform is more than just an intermediary or middleware. Its\nprimary purpose is to move data between tools. It also serves as a repository\nfor all of this vital information, allowing different teams within a company\nto access it whenever they need it.\n\nFor example, if the marketing team wants to experiment with Pinterest\nadvertising and wants to target a specific group of users based on their\nprevious behaviour, they can easily create an audience in the CDP by combining\nuser attributes, events, and data from other campaigns, and pipe this\ninformation to Pinterest. A CDP can also create unified customer profiles,\nwhich allow businesses to see all of a customer's activities in one place.\nWhile this sounds great in theory, no one has time to sift through each\ncustomer's activity in practice; thus, having a \"single view of the customer\"\nshould not be the primary motivation for implementing a CDP.\n\nThe CDP you choose should include out-of-the-box integrations with popular\nsystems like:  \n\n  * Platforms for marketing automation\n  * Databases, data warehouses, and data lakes are all types of data storage.\n  * CRMs\n  * IoT and sensor data are being advertised.\n  * Business intelligence (BI) platforms.\n  * Google Analytics\n  * Ecommerce\n  * Use of social media\n\nThe primary capabilities of the CDP are as follows:\n\n  1. Ingestion of data.  \nCDPs collect first-party customer information from a variety of sources (e.g.,\ntransactional systems, web behavior, call center, demographics, or POS).  \n\n  2. Management of one's identity:   \nCustomers' identities are resolved by CDPs across multiple channels. With\nidentifiers provided by the inbound data, the majority use deterministic\nmatching and profile stitching. A persistent customer identifier is created\nand maintained by the CDP.  \n\n  3. Segmentation  \nWith the unified data in the CDP, marketers can create and maintain universal,\nomnichannel audience segmentation.  \n\n  4. Data provision/activation  \nCDPs make it easier to put the CDP's insights and unified customer profiles\ninto action. Connectors and APIs to other marketing technologies are used to\naccomplish this.\n\nThe large variety of data that can be stored and unified is a distinguishing\nfeature of a customer data platform. Here are a few examples of common data\nsources.\n\n  * Data on transactions and orders: Client purchases, order and renewal dates, customer value, abandoned carts, returns, and other information are generated by eCommerce, administration, and sales systems. All of this information is extremely useful for marketing and sales efforts.\n  * Behavioral, web and mobile data are essential for determining current and potential customers' behaviour and preferences. It details the products and categories they've looked at, as well as the number of pages they've visited per session, the average session duration, and more.\n  * Customer profiles: Customers are at the heart of every business. Knowing who they are and what they want allows you to market to them more effectively. You can add psychographic data to your lead generation forms to learn more about your users' preferences.\n  * Although not strictly customer data, product data allows you to have more personalised and meaningful interactions with customers. Inventory levels and pricing are two basic examples of product data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhen it comes to building their own martech stack, today's marketing\ntechnology landscape includes a plethora of technologies. Connecting the dots\nbetween multiple best-of-breed solutions is a difficult task. Data silos form\nwhen information cannot be shared between systems.\n\nBy allowing the collection of customer data from multiple systems into a\nsingle location, a CDP makes the best-of-breed challenge easier to overcome.\nThe \"back-end\" of your CDP serves as a central intelligence hub for all of\nyour marketing systems. APIs in modern digital marketing and sales solutions\nmake it simple to connect to the CDP and export and import customer data in\norder to create personalised marketing campaigns.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/tag/automated-data-processing/", "title": "Automated Data Processing Archives - Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Automated Data Processing\n\n##  Case Study | Sales Data Pipeline & Forecasting Built for the Hustle\n\nFebruary 24, 2025 7:20 am\n\nGuesswork in sales forecasting?

Intelligent\nconnectivity\u2014the fusion of 5G, Cloud, Big Data, IoT, and AI\u2014is driving the\nnext wave of technological advancement, transforming industries and redefining\nuser experiences. By seamlessly integrating these technologies, businesses can\nunlock new efficiencies, improve customer experiences, and pave the way for\nunprecedented innovations.\n\n### **AI & IoT: A Powerful Synergy**\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized how we interact with devices,\nbut AI is the key to unlocking its true potential. AI analyzes the massive\ninflux of IoT-generated data, making it more relevant and actionable. By\nharnessing AI-driven insights, businesses can make informed decisions,\nautomate processes, and enhance operational efficiency. AI's predictive\ncapabilities also allow for proactive maintenance, anomaly detection, and\nbetter resource management across various industries.\n\nWhile many focus on individual smart devices, the Internet of Experiences\nextends beyond\u2014a concept where interconnected smart devices work together to\ncreate enhanced decision-making systems and deliver hyper-personalized\nexperiences. This shift moves us from merely connected devices to intelligent,\nimmersive services that redefine customer engagement.\n\n### **5G: The Missing Link in Intelligent Connectivity**\n\nThe adoption of IoT is accelerating, but a critical enabler has been\nmissing\u2014until now. 5G technology, with its ultra-fast speeds, low latency, and\nhigh reliability, provides the necessary foundation for seamless intelligent\nconnectivity. By ensuring real-time data transmission and ultra-responsive\nnetworks, 5G is unlocking new possibilities for IoT applications across\nindustries.\n\nFrom autonomous vehicles making split-second decisions to smart factories\noptimizing production in real time, 5G-powered intelligent connectivity is set\nto reshape industries, offering unprecedented speed and efficiency. The\ncombination of AI, IoT, and 5G enables seamless communication between devices,\ndriving real-time automation and process optimization.\n\n### **Transforming Business with Intelligent Connectivity**\n\nIoT is not just about smart homes or connected wearables; it is reshaping\nentire business models. As AI and IoT integration advance, organizations are\ndiscovering new ways to engage with customers, streamline operations, and\ncreate monetizable services. The key driver of this transformation is the end-\nuser perspective\u2014ensuring that the technology being developed meets real-world\nneeds and adds tangible value.\n\nIndustries from healthcare to manufacturing, transportation to security are\nwitnessing a paradigm shift. Intelligent connectivity is enabling predictive\nmaintenance in factories, real-time health monitoring, safer autonomous\nvehicles, and enhanced security infrastructure. For example, in healthcare,\nAI-driven IoT devices can monitor patients remotely, providing real-time\nalerts to medical professionals, while in manufacturing, connected machinery\ncan predict failures before they occur, reducing downtime and operational\ncosts.\n\n### **The Road Ahead**\n\nThe future of intelligent connectivity is bright. With continuous advancements\nin AI, IoT, and 5G, we are moving towards a world where technology anticipates\nneeds, automates routine tasks, and enhances human experiences in ways never\nimagined before. Organizations that embrace this transformation will be at the\nforefront of innovation, delivering smarter, more personalized, and more\nefficient services.\n\nAs businesses navigate the era of intelligent connectivity, they must adapt to\nthe evolving technological landscape, invest in scalable solutions, and\nprioritize security and privacy. The interconnected digital world presents\nboth opportunities and challenges, but those who leverage its full potential\nwill lead the charge in innovation and customer satisfaction.\n\nNext  __\n\n### Unveiling Amazon Q : The Future of Generative AI for Enterprises\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/tag/cold-chain-management/", "title": "cold chain management Archives - Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# cold chain management\n\n##  IoT in Supply Chains: The Game-Changer Your Business Needs !!\n\nAugust 16, 2024 6:24 am\n\nReady to level up your supply chain?

React and Vue can be considered as the leading and popular ones.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Vue or React - Who will win this battle?\n\nJavascript is one of the prevailing languages of the web and its popularity is\ncontinuously growing. Many javascript framework are coming out every year and\nwe are continuously witnessing fierce and exciting challenges and comparisons\namong the emerging frameworks. Choosing the right javascript can always be\nchallenging and it is one of the most critical and important steps toward the\nsuccess of your web project.\n\nReact and Vue can be considered as a leading and popular javascript framework\nin the world. Both frameworks provide the developers with an efficient tool to\nbuild their web applications. Both frameworks have their own merits and they\ncan respond to different business requirements. So we will articulate the\nmerits and demerits of both frameworks along with market trends and insights\nwhich provides more clarity about the frameworks and thus compare them more\neffectively to find the most favourable one.\n\n### **The question, then, arises: Which one to pick for your next web\ndevelopment project?**\n\n## **History** of javascript framework\n\nReact is an open-source javascript library developed in 2013 by Facebook for\nbuilding interactive user interfaces. React has backing by this tech giant.\nThis ensures the stability of React and they also receive long term support\nfrom Facebook.\n\nVue is the youngest member of the javascript framework.  It is developed in\n2014 by the ex-google employee named Evan. It started with a vision to create\na framework that combined the features of popular frameworks like react,\nangular, and ember. Vue has gained much popularity through these years even\nthough it is not backed by any large companies.\n\n## **Similarities** of javascript framework\n\nBefore going to the differences between the 2 frameworks, we will look into\nthe similarities between them\n\n  * The most significant common trait is Virtual-DOM. In the case of regular DOM, there is a re-rendering of the whole page. React and Vue uses the virtual DOM and thus update only those objects that have changed.\n  * React and Vue are lightweight. They have a component-based architecture that has considerable libraries which promotes code reuse, improve developer productivity, and speed up the development process.\n  * Both support libraries used for building mobile applications\n\n## Diff**erences**\n\n### **Code Style:**\n\nReact relies on JavaScript XML popularly known as JSX which is a means of\nadding HTML code within the javascript. Everything within the React\nenvironment is treated as a single component by the javascript framework. The\ncomponent lifecycle offers a way of attaching specific lifecycle events like\nupdates, creation, etc. The XML-like syntax grants building self-contained UI\ncomponents with view-rendering instructions.\n\nCoding in Vue is similar to that in Angular but it gets rid of the demerits of\nAngular. Vue is way much easier to learn when compared to React. Vue decouples\nJavaScript, HTML, and CSS which helps the developers to create web\napplications easily and also allows you to use JSX. Vue doesn\u2019t force you to\nchange your coding style.\n\n### **Learning Curve:**\n\nThe official React documentation to act as a guide for developers who have\nsome experience in front end framework. React is not a complete framework. It\nis dependent on other third-party components for effective use. It demands a\nlot of time and effort even for an experienced developer. The developer needs\nto have a good understanding of js libraries.\n\nOne of the most fascinating aspects of Vue is that it is much easier for a JS\ndeveloper to follow the framework and work with it. The documentation of Vue\nis well written and covers everything required.\n\n### **Flexibility:**\n\nState management is one of the important features. Hence Vue and React pay\nclose attention to state management and data flow since there are a number of\nunits interacting with each other and sharing data.\n\nReact is best for building user interfaces. It focuses on the essential things\nrelated to the user experience. Most of the React applications adopt Redux,\nwhich is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state, for\nstate management. Mobx, which is a library that makes state management simple\nand scalable, is also gaining major attention these days.\n\nVue is also considered as a flexible javascript framework. It provides all\nthose elements for building an app and also provides bonus features like\n\n  * Vuex for state management\n  * Vue Router for routing\n  * Vue Server-Side Renderer for Server-Side Rendering\n\n### **Popularity:**\n\nAccording to NPM, React has been a leader in popularity among all other\nJavaScript frameworks. The downloads of the react package have crossed 330\nmillion and the downloads of Vue package have crossed 66 million from June\n2019 to June 2020. Stack overflow trends present React at the top position.\nAnother insight we get is the rising popularity of Vue over these years. Stack\noverflow gives this data based on all the questions received from developers\nand it is seen that there is a considerable increase in the queries related to\nVue after React. GitHub also gives the impression of  Vue as a highly rated\nframework after React and React has the most Fork and view rates, but Vue has\nthe most stars.\n\n### **Performance:**\n\nPerformance is an important feature to be considered for front end\napplications. On assessing the overall performance of frameworks, DOM(Document\nObject Model) is considered the User Interface of any application. When\ncompared to React, Vue has the best approach to update HTML files. React has\ngained fame for its incredible speed but Vue is also an exceptionally fast\ntool. Both Vue and React utilize Virtual DOM. Vue delivers high performance\nand memory allocation and helps to overcome the difficulties faced in using\nReact and other frameworks.\n\n### **Talent Hiring:**\n\nSince react has been backed by  Facebook, it has gained popularity since its\nbeginning. Even though Vue is easier to learn when compared to React, there\nare a significantly large number of React developers in the market than Vue\ndevelopers. Hiring a React developer is the best option when there is a need\nfor complex applications in a business environment and also considering the\nfact that there are more projects utilizing React than Vue. According to many\nsources like LinkedIn, glassdoor and Indeed, React developers have more demand\nor job offers than the Vue developers.\n\nReact is way much ahead of Vue in case of the opportunities but Vue is young\nand growing and as time passes it may attain more popularity and provide\nhigher competition to React.\n\n## **Apps built with React**\n\n### Facebook\n\n### Instagram\n\n### Whatsapp\n\n### Netflix\n\n### Uber\n\n### Pinterest\n\n### Twitter\n\n## **Apps built with Vue**\n\n### 9gag\n\n### Gitlab\n\n### Behance\n\n### Alibaba\n\n### Grammarly\n\n## **Summary**\n\nWhen you want to make a choice between the Javascript framework- Vue and\nReact, it comes down to your business requirements. React is the most popular\nand leading player in the industry. It is treated as the trendsetter and is a\nhighly demanded skill. Many javascript framework have tried their best to get\nthe name and fame but failed except Vue which has attracted developers\nrecently. Vue in spite of being a freshman, it has managed to stay along with\nReact due to its special qualities like performance, simple to learn, the\nflexible and complete package. React is chosen for complex apps with the\nmotive to expand it in the future. You should go with Vue if you need a simple\nand light-weighted app.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Let us prepare ourselves for the unique possibilities that the NFT and Metaverse has in store for us. Sinergia Media Labs.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# The NFT Metaverse: A Growing Trend in the Blockchain Industry.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFT) indicate a person's ownership of digital assets like\nsocial media postings, digital art, paintings, signatures, and so on. NFT can\nrepresent the tokenized form of real-world assets, like land and buildings, in\naddition to any intangible or digital material.\n\nNon-fungible tokens and the underlying technology of NFTs play a crucial role\nin developing the Metaverse. NFTs exist on the blockchain, which was initially\nuseful to trade digital assets, and now it has diverse use cases. If we\ndemonstrate the role of NFTs within the digital environment of the Metaverse,\nNFTs integrate with existing VR and AR technology and thus regulate the whole\nspace.\n\nWhen it comes to the world of crypto, currency units are similarly fungible\nand interchangeable, but not all digital assets are. That\u2019s where NFTs come\nin.\n\nFurthermore, the digitalization of material \u2014 including art, music, films,\nbooks, and even news or blog articles \u2014 has thrown ownership, copyrights, and\nintellectual property into disarray. This is owing to how easily digital media\ncan be copied and replicated. According to Bloomberg, the metaverse income\nopportunity in 2024 will be over $800 billion, up from $500 billion in 2020.\nIn 2024, the major market for online game developers and gaming gear may top\n$400 billion, with the balance coming from live entertainment and social\nmedia. The metaverse is the next great technological platform, drawing online\ngame developers, social media platforms, and corporate titans to capitalise on\nthis developing industry. Nonetheless, NFTs allow owners of many forms of\ndigital content to sell and trade their assets while making use of the\nbenefits given by the decentralised crypto ecosystem.\n\n**Types of NFTs**\n\nAnything digital can be turned into an NFT, which opens up a lot of\npossibilities. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who sold his first tweet as an NFT for\nmore than $2.9 million, is a prominent example of an NFT. However, the\nfollowing are some of the most popular forms of NFT:\n\n  * Artwork\n  * Trading Cards\n  * Memorable sports moments\n  * Domain names\n  * Game assets\n  * GIFs/ memes\n\nTo provide the asset owner real digital ownership, NFT technology is required.\nHowever, the practicality of NFTs in blockchain games is the primary reason\nfor their popularity in the Metaverse. By complementing the virtual\nenvironment, interoperable games encourage the growth of the gaming Metaverse.\nNFTs also play the following roles in the Metaverse:\n\n  * Through NFTs, Metaverse gives users access to their digital avatars (replicas of real-life identities). To establish ownership of the appropriate persona, each avatar is tokenized.\n  * NFT ticketing system is used to distribute tickets to the intended audiences at Metaverse events such as music concerts and live events.\n  * The NFT system is used to grant ownership and transfer it for trade in the secondary market for in-game goods and accessories like as skins, armors, and tanks.\n\n**The Connection Between Metaverse and NFTs**\n\nThe digital assets and how they are valued are the connecting dots between\nmetaverse and NFTs. Users may display a multitude of digital forms of art and\nproperty in the metaverse, and NFTs will allow them to price that stuff and\nprove ownership.\n\nToday, Metaverse establishes a new class of tech entrepreneurs and freelancers\nin the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia, by erecting virtual barriers\nto safeguard crypto-wallets and platforms to sell tech using non-fungible\ntokens. The Indian government cannot afford to procrastinate in making digital\ncurrency choices and a path for economic growth based on it.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMetaverse is still in its infancy, and its horizon is continually growing,\nthanks to large firms investing in the technology and releasing a variety of\nviable use cases. We constantly hear about new Metaverse projects with\ndifferent features being introduced. It foreshadows a future version of the\nMetaverse, one that must be far more advanced than the one we now visit.\n\nOn mobile, blockchain-based applications and NFT functionalities are becoming\nincreasingly popular. In this new industry, consumer rivalry will heat up,\nmaking effective user acquisition strategies crucial to success. Furthermore,\nthe Metaverse will be complemented by the expansion of virtual reality,\nincreased internet accessibility, and the widespread use of blockchain\ntechnology, allowing it to meet expanding demand patterns.\n\nWe all, on the other hand, are looking forward to living in the decentralised\ninteroperable Metaverse and making use of its benefits. Let us prepare\nourselves for the unique possibilities that the Metaverse has in store for us.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/live-law/", "title": "Live Law - A portal that brings you latest legal news - Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "We are India\u2019s number 1 legal news portal which is unbiased and based on the solid ethical core.

Digital technology has caused a\ntransition in journalism where now journalists have to make sure that they\nhave attractive content, moving images, and best interviews. Digital\njournalism has created a lot of competition and forced each journal to be more\nperfect than the other. Thus the public receives more legitimate news in one\nway or another.\n\nSimelabs have helped live law attain their digital enterprise by developing a\nstartling website and mobile application which have enhanced the user\nexperience.

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Explore how Real-Time Business Intelligence (RTBI) empowers organizations to make instant data-driven decisions, enhance customer experiences, and gain a competitive edge. Learn about RTBI benefits, use cases across industries, and future trends like AI integration and edge computing", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Real-Time Business Intelligence : Driving Instant Decision-Making\n\nIn today's fast-paced business landscape, the ability to make informed\ndecisions in real time has become a critical factor for success. Organizations\nacross industries are dealing with vast amounts of data generated from various\nsources such as IoT devices, social media, transactional systems, and more.\nTraditional business intelligence (BI) systems that rely on batch processing\nand periodic reporting are no longer sufficient to meet the demands of modern\nbusinesses. Real-time Business Intelligence (RTBI) bridges this gap by\nproviding organizations with the capability to access, analyze, and act on\ndata instantaneously. With the increasing need for agility and responsiveness,\nRTBI is becoming an essential tool to enhance decision-making, improve\ncustomer experiences, and gain a competitive edge in the market. Businesses\nthat harness the power of real-time data analytics can proactively identify\nopportunities, mitigate risks, and optimize operations in ways that were\npreviously impossible.\n\n## **What is Real-Time Business Intelligence?**\n\nReal-Time Business Intelligence (RTBI) refers to the process of collecting,\nprocessing, and analyzing data as it is generated, providing immediate\ninsights for decision-making. Unlike traditional BI systems, which rely on\nbatch processing and periodic reporting, RTBI delivers up-to-the-minute\ninformation, allowing businesses to respond to opportunities and challenges as\nthey arise.\n\nFaster decision-making is one of the most significant advantages of RTBI. With\ninstant access to data, businesses can make quicker, more informed decisions,\nreducing response times and improving operational efficiency. This enables\norganizations to stay agile and responsive to changing market conditions.\nAdditionally, real-time insights enhance the customer experience by allowing\nbusinesses to personalize interactions and offer proactive support, which in\nturn boosts satisfaction and customer loyalty.\n\nAnother key benefit of RTBI is improved operational efficiency. By\ncontinuously monitoring business processes, organizations can identify\nbottlenecks and inefficiencies, leading to streamlined operations. Real-time\ndata also provides a competitive advantage, as businesses can respond to\nmarket changes faster and gain an edge over their competitors. Moreover,\nproactive monitoring of real-time data helps in risk mitigation by detecting\nanomalies and potential threats before they escalate.\n\n## **Components of a Real-Time BI System**\n\nA robust RTBI system typically includes the following components:\n\n  * **Data Sources:** Streaming data from IoT devices, social media, transactional systems, and sensors.\n  * **Data Ingestion:** Tools such as Apache Kafka, Azure Event Hubs, and AWS Kinesis that facilitate real-time data collection.\n  * **Data Processing:** Frameworks like Apache Flink, Spark Streaming, and cloud-based solutions that process data with low latency.\n  * **Data Visualization:** Dashboards and analytics platforms such as Power BI, Tableau, and Looker for instant insights.\n  * **Automated Alerts & Actions:** AI-driven systems that trigger automated responses based on real-time data patterns.\n\n## **Use Cases of Real-Time BI Across Industries**\n\n  * **Retail - **Retailers leverage RTBI to track customer behavior in real time, optimize inventory, and deliver personalized promotions based on current trends.\n  * **Healthcare - **Hospitals and clinics utilize RTBI to monitor patient vitals continuously, detect anomalies, and provide timely interventions.\n  * **Finance - **Financial institutions use RTBI for fraud detection, risk management, and real-time portfolio analysis.\n  * **Manufacturing - **Manufacturers apply RTBI to monitor equipment performance, predict maintenance needs, and optimize supply chain operations.\n  * **Logistics - **Logistics companies benefit from RTBI by tracking shipments in real time, optimizing delivery routes, and improving fleet management.\n\n## **Challenges of Implementing Real-Time BI**\n\nDespite its numerous benefits, deploying an RTBI system comes with challenges\nsuch as data volume and velocity. Handling large streams of data in real time\nrequires robust infrastructure and architecture to ensure seamless processing\nand analysis. Organizations must invest in high-performance computing and\nscalable solutions to manage the continuous influx of data efficiently.\nMoreover, integration complexity poses another challenge, as businesses need\nto combine data from multiple sources while maintaining consistency and\naccuracy across the system.\n\nSecurity concerns also play a critical role in the implementation of RTBI.\nReal-time data processing necessitates stringent security measures to prevent\nbreaches and unauthorized access, which could lead to significant business\nrisks. Organizations must implement strong encryption, authentication\nprotocols, and compliance frameworks to safeguard their data assets.\nAdditionally, cost considerations are an important factor, as building and\nmaintaining an RTBI infrastructure can be expensive. Businesses need to\ncarefully evaluate their return on investment (ROI) and identify cost-\neffective strategies to leverage real-time insights without overspending.\n\n## **Future Trends in Real-Time BI**\n\nAs technology evolves, several trends are shaping the future of RTBI:\n\n  * **AI/ML Integration:** AI-powered analytics will enhance the predictive capabilities of real-time BI systems.\n  * **Edge Computing:** Processing data closer to the source will reduce latency and improve response times.\n  * **Cloud Adoption:** Cloud platforms will continue to offer scalable and cost-effective solutions for real-time analytics.\n  * **Augmented Analytics:** The use of natural language processing (NLP) and AI-driven insights will make BI more accessible to non-technical users.\n\n* * *\n\n**Real-Time Business Intelligence is transforming the way organizations\noperate, providing them with the agility and insights needed to thrive in the\ndigital economy. By leveraging RTBI, businesses can make data-driven decisions\ninstantly, enhance customer experiences, and gain a competitive advantage in\ntheir respective industries. Investing in the right tools, technologies, and\nstrategies will be key to unlocking the full potential of real-time BI.**\n\n* * *\n\nAt Simelabs, we specialize in providing cutting-edge real-time business\nintelligence solutions tailored to your unique business needs.

Indventr is the consortium of 3 startups namely Simelabs, Aruvii\nand Ionic 3DP ventures who worked together to achieve the common objective of\nproviding efficient and cost-effective ventilators.\n\nRajagiri School of Engineering, Cochin has always put great efforts in\nfostering collaboration between academics and industry and in turn research\nhelps students and faculties to attain greater knowledge by closely working\nwith the industry. Indventr is about to take baby steps into this world and\ntogether they can rely on each other for strength, gain more insights and thus\ncombine technical skills, knowledge and resources to address challenges.\nSimelabs and Rajagiri school of engineering has forged this research\npartnership to drive more innovation, make improvements to the existing\nventilators and thus serve the society.\n\nIndventr has already completed the prototype and validation of two of the\nventilation solution which includes Indvenr-100, a BVM based automated\nresuscitator and Indventr-200, a multi-mode capable pneumatic designed\nventilator with options to control ventilation pressure, volume, make\nadjustments based on the lungs compliance and also support real-time\nmonitoring of the covid-19 patients.\n\niSave is again an innovative approach by Indventr that enables a platform\nwhich serves more patients using a single ventilator and the validation of\nthis solution has been recently published in the Science Translational\nMedicine. It's a rigorously validated, well thought out design, priced very\nlow when compared to the other ventilation services and can scale up the\nservices of the ventilator to many more people around the world.\n\nThis partnership of Simelabs' Indventr with one of the aspiring universities\nwill enable Indventr to increase efficiency, ensure compliance, add value to\nour existing solutions and also help the project to reach out to the public.\n\nNext  __\n\n### Simelabs' Indventr and the Prana foundation promote impactful\ncollaboration\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "How to boost your scrum calls in agile project management system. Click to know more.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# How to boost Scrum Calls\n\nAny sort of product-based work cannot happen effectively without updating and\nproductivity. Daily standup meetings, often known as Scrum calls, are an\nexcellent approach for teams to improve their productivity and communication.\nScrum is a simple agile project management framework that can be used to\ncreate and manage all sorts of iterative and incremental projects. The\nreasoning is to break down huge, difficult tasks into smaller stages,\nevaluating and changing as needed.**** These short meetings take place at the\nsame time and place every day so that team members can discuss their goals and\nroadblocks while keeping the conversation action-oriented. The daily scrum\nmeeting is designed to assist team members in focusing on common goals. It\nshould also assist students in making a commitment to their goals. The daily\nscrum meeting is frequently held while the team is standing. The standing\nportion is crucial. Standing teams are more focused and energetic. An\nindividual who sits down will not have the same feeling of urgency, causing\nthe meeting to drag on longer than it should. Before we get into the details\nfurther, let\u2019s have a brief about agile project management as well.\n\n### **Agile project management****\n\n'Agile' is a catch-all phrase that refers to a variety of agile development\nmethodologies, including Scrum. Agile project management is a specific topic\nin projects. The Agile approach is a project management strategy that breaks\ndown a project into segments. It needs regular communication with stakeholders\nas well as continuing growth at all levels. Once the project begins, teams go\nthrough a cycle of planning, executing, and evaluating. Collaboration between\nteam members and project stakeholders is critical. The scrum team refers to\nthe group of people that are working on the project. A Scrum team is normally\nsmall, ranging from three to 10 persons, however bigger (and smaller) teams\nare occasionally required. Scrum Teams are self-organized and cross-\nfunctional, which means they find out how to accomplish their work, manage\nthemselves as they work, and have all of the abilities they need to get the\njob done. Remember that the Scrum Master's product and primary aim is a Well-\nFormed Team.\n\n### **Scrum Master****\n\nScrum Master is a Scrum framework job that is in charge of ensuring that\neveryone understands Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values. You'll\ncommunicate with and coach people both inside and outside your Scrum Team as\nyou take on the position of Scrum Master.\n\nThe scrum master is expected to function as a coach inside your team, ensuring\nthat your team follows agile ideals and principles. They also serve as a\nmirror, ensuring that your team adheres to the procedures and methodologies\nyou agreed to adopt. They assist their team in establishing efficient contacts\nwith stakeholders and other teams on the outside. This frequently necessitates\ncoaching stakeholders on how to communicate with the team.\n\n### **How to boost Scrum calls?****\n\n  * Maintain the focus of the meetings.\n\nMaking ensuring the meeting stays on track is the first step toward an\nefficient Scrum meeting. To do this, the only subjects that should be covered\nat this time are the projects that each team member is working on and the\nissues that they are encountering.\n\n  * Keep the meetings brief.\n\nOverly long daily scrums are ineffective. Participants may become sidetracked\nand this can lead to a lack of attention eventually. As a result, your staff\nstarts to dislike these meetings, and communication breaks down. That is why\nit is critical to keep your meeting duration to a minimum. People are more\ninclined to pay attention and deem them vital if they are shorter.\n\nCertain organizations use the formula 2n + 5 minutes, where n is the total\nnumber of people on their squad. In any case, following the 3-question rule\nwill ensure that your team gets all of the information they want within the\ntime constraints.\n\n  * For unsettled difficulties, use a 'Parking Lot.'\n\nThe goal of daily scrum meetings is to inform team members on what is being\ndone, what remains to be done, and what obstacles are preventing them from\nbeing completed. Anything not on this list must be dealt with later. Create a\n'parking lot' and a list of concerns that will be addressed later. Schedule\nanother meeting with only those members who are directly involved with that\nproblem once the first one is done. You might have a notebook or a whiteboard\nhandy to keep track of subjects that should be addressed by a certain sub-\ndivision and require more in-depth discussion. Such 'parking lots' should be\navailable to team members outside of daily scrum sessions as well, where they\nmay write down their action items. They will be completely focused and will\nnot be distracted during their daily scrum meetings.\n\n  * Remote employees should be included in daily Scrum meetings.\n\nThe fact that remote employees aren't physically there with the rest of the\nteam doesn't imply they can't participate in daily Scrum. During the daily\nstand-up, they can conference call in or, even better, video chat. Of course,\nthere are logistical considerations when organizing this, since you must\naccount for many time zones. Make sure you're not forcing a team member to\nattend a Scrum meeting at an inconvenient hour. It's beneficial for team\nmorale and project progress to keep distant workers participating. By\nrequesting that they call in once a day, you can guarantee that your team is\nworking together and that concerns are being addressed.\n\n  * Schedule Scrum Refinement at the Appropriate Time\n\nIt's wise to improve your scrum a little after the midway point of a sprint.\nThe start of the sprint isn't ideal because this is when work picks up and\nmomentum is established. Because you need time to populate the backlog, you\nshouldn't do it in the middle. Your team will be so busy finishing off their\nresponsibilities at the conclusion of the sprint that they won't have time to\ngroom the backlog. As a result, three-quarters of the way through a sprint (or\n60%) is optimum.\n\nThese meetings, whether referred to as a daily scrum, daily huddle, morning\nroll-call, morning meetings, coordination meetings, or our own stand-up\nmeetings, are the order of the day. The team members have a clear and\ncoordinated idea of how much work has been completed and how much work remains\nby receiving an update on what each team member performed yesterday and what\nhe wants to do today. These meetings also serve as a means of ensuring that\nall members fulfill their obligations. When a member stands up and declares,\n\"I will do this duty today,\" he understands that he must report whether the\nassignment was completed or not the next day.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/erc-721-nft-smart-contract-deployment-using-hardhat/", "title": "ERC-721 (NFT) Smart Contract Deployment\u2014 using Hardhat - Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "A guide on how to write and deploy ERC-721 standard smart contract", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# ERC-721 (NFT) Smart Contract Deployment\u2014 using Hardhat\n\nChikku George Software Engineer | ReactJs | NodeJs | NestJs\n\nA guide on how to write and deploy ERC-721 standard smart contract\n\n _As part of this article, we are trying to write and deploy the ERC-721\nstandard smart contract on Polygon Mumbai Testnet using the Hardhat\nconfiguration._\n\n_What are smart contracts?

Rather than\nimproving software in one large batch, updates are made continuously, piece-\nby-piece, enabling software code to be delivered to customers as soon as it is\ncompleted and tested.\n\n  *     * ### Continuous Exploration\n\n* * *\n\nA process that drives innovation and fosters alignment on what should be built\nby continually exploring the market and customer needs, and defining a Vision,\nRoadmap, set of features and services for a solution that addresses those\nneeds\n\n    * ### Continuous Integration\n\n* * *\n\nThe practice of integrating changes from different developers in the team into\na mainline as early as possible, in best cases several times a day. This makes\nyour code dependable\n\n  *     * ### Continuous Delivery\n\n* * *\n\nWe keep the codebase deployable at any point. Beyond making sure the\napplication passes automated tests it has to have all the configuration\nnecessary to push it into production. Teams then do push changes that pass the\nautomated tests into a test or production environment\n\n    * ### Continuous Deployment\n\n* * *\n\nWe use the strategy of continuous deployment for software releases wherein any\ncode commit that passes the automated testing phase is automatically released\ninto the production environment, making changes that are visible to the\nsoftware's users\n\n  *     * ### Continuous Feedback\n\n* * *\n\nInfrastructure, application & database are automatically scaled up & down\nbased on demand. Feedback detects abnormal behaviour & switches over\nautomatically before critical failure occurs\n\n    * ### Continuous Learning\n\n* * *\n\nContinuous learning will only strengthen any DevOps environment you implement.\nExpected and actual customer impact is evaluated, the learnings trigger a new\nhypothesis and start the next code experiment\n\n## Our philosophy in product design & development\n\nWe believe in creating digital customer experiences that people love and\nclients are proud of calling their own.\n\n  * ### Discovery\n\nAs the old saying goes: If you have four hours to chop down a tree, spend the\nfirst three hours sharpening your axe. The same goes for design. Before you\nget started with any project, you need to get the basics down firstResearch\nabout everything that we are curious about the users and the case. The final\ngoal is putting ourselves in user\u2019s shoes and understanding their problems and\nwhat they need.\n\n  * ### Ideation\n\nFrom the problem worth solving, list down the negative feelings when the\nproblems are unsolved (left) , and the positive feelings when the problem\nsolved (right). Based on the feelings, think about the solution for that.\n\n  * ### Create\n\nNow, it\u2019s time to actually build out your design. One of the most important\nthings you can create at this stage is the wireframe. It\u2019s a low fidelity\nversion of what your product will eventually look like. This is an iterative\nprocess. That means you won\u2019t get it all done in the first go. You\u2019ll have to\ndesign, redesign, scrap it, and design it all again. Hyperventilation and\noverconsumption of coffee is completely natural at this stage.\n\n  * ### Launch\n\nAfter designing and redesigning until you go cross eyed, you\u2019re going to reach\na point where all your assets are ready to ship. That means it\u2019s time to\nimplement; pass everything to the development team who will create a high\nfidelity version of the user interface.\n\n  * ### Iterate\n\nOnce your product launches, it\u2019s time for another round of analysis. Instead\nof looking at the results of your research, though, you\u2019ll be taking a look at\nyour overall final product.By thoroughly analyzing the product and the UX\nprocess, you\u2019ll be able to get more out of the experience than just a\nproduct\u2014you also gain invaluable knowledge you can leverage for the future.\n\nFeatured Case Studies\n\n### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\nA Healthcare Transformation Journey with Simelabs -

With the growing population, there is an increased demand for\nfood. In order to meet the growing requirements we need to increase the\nproductivity in agriculture and this is not an easy task. It requires high\ncare, good quality resources. They do have limited resources like land, water,\nlabours and this can worsen the situation. Farmers look into more new and\ninnovative methods of agriculture which involves new technologies. In Order to\nincrease productivity, we need to give continuous care and there are lots of\nworks which involve repetition and this is done with the help of automation in\nagriculture. This technology has brought profit and productivity to farmers\nalong with handling the repetitive tasks. Agriculture based firms face a lot\nof competition and they look for new ways to attain success and thus boost\ntheir profit.\n\n  \n\n## What are the challenges faced in the agriculture sector?\n\nAgriculture based companies face a lot of challenges. They need to monitor\neverything like plant health, soil conditions, weather conditions. Moreover,\nthey also need to look into the finances, yields. Moreover, the companies\nshould also look into the current market price of the product every time and\nkeep a track of them and the changes in the price. The companies should always\nmaintain good communication with suppliers and buyers. More than this even\nagriculture includes a lot of repetitive tasks which involves a high workload\nand there are only very few skilled people. So we need to free people from\nthese repetitive tasks and automation is the solution. Robotic process\nautomation helps farmers and company to automate most of the repetitive tasks\nso that they could spend their valuable time on more important tasks which\nneed attention and skill. This can lead to increased productivity and hence\nmore profit.\n\n### What is Robotic Process Automation?\n\nRobotic process automation is a technology which allows organisations to\nautomate repetitive and routine tasks. It is an application which mimics human\nbehaviour. In general its a technology which reduces effort by imitating human\nbehaviour and can work more effectively and accurately.\n\n###  Benefits of Automating Agricultural processes\n\nA number of benefits are achieved by the company and farmers while using\nautomation. By using automation methods, it reduces human labour as many of\nthe jobs done by the people are being replaced. Robotic Process Automation has\nhelped the companies to automate the farm by analysing the price details,\nweather conditions, benefits automatically without any human intervention.\n\nHumans are prone to errors and tiredness and by using Robotic Process\nAutomation in agriculture, it increases the efficiency and reliability of\nwork. It also increases the speed and thus works happen at a faster rate. With\nthe help of Robotic Process Automation, it makes the monitoring of crops,\nfields, prices, processes easier. They also verify everything is working\nefficiently. Market and trade are being well managed by the Robotic Process\nAutomation. It leads to faster management processes.\n\n###  Advantages of using Robotic Process Automation in Agricultural industry\n\nReduced human labour: It frees people from doing tedious and repetitive tasks\nwhich involves a lot of time. By using Robotic Process Automation it does the\nsame task more efficiently in less time. Now human labour can be used for more\nimportant and high prioritised work which needs more skill and attention.\n\nReduces error: When people are prone to repetitive tasks, there is an\nincreased chance of errors to come up. So Robotic Process Automation reduces\nhuman errors to a greater extent and enhanced data accuracy.  \n\nIncreased Quality: Since most of the tasks are done by machines, the quality\nof work is improved. It also leads to reduced errors and less response time.\nIt handles tasks in a better way and thus creates stability.\n\nAgriculture is changing rapidly. Rising population and shifting policies have\naffected the prices, supply and delivery of the food products. These growing\ndemands are to be fulfilled by the company which is facing a shortage of\nresources as well as human labour. Using Robotic Process Automation to\nautomate various tasks have cut down the expenses and increased production and\nprofit. Robotic Process Automation has helped to improve efficiency and save\ntime. Thus Robotic Process Automation in agriculture business is more\nprofitable and effective.  \n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Tap the link to read.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# IoT in Smart Manufacturing\n\nLearn how smart manufacturing is opening doors for larger possibilities in\nbusiness and technology.\n\nTechnology is so fast-paced that every other day something new comes up. To\ndeal with such a system complexity, increase information visibility, improve\nproduction performance, and gain competitive advantages in the global market,\nthe modern manufacturing industry is investing in new technologies such as the\nInternet of Things (IoT), data analytics, cloud computing, and smart\nmanufacturing. These advancements are fast allowing a new age of smart\nmanufacturing, i.e., a cyber-physical system that intimately integrates\nphysical manufacturing firms with virtual enterprises in cyberspace. Realizing\nthe full potential of cyber-physical systems is heavily reliant on the\ndevelopment of new approaches for data-enabled engineering breakthroughs on\nthe Internet of Manufacturing Things (IoMT).\n\n### **Manufacturing vs Smart Manufacturing**\n\nSmart manufacturing is a wide notion that cannot be directly utilized in a\nmanufacturing process. Smart manufacturing is a concept that refers to a\ncollection of technologies and solutions that, when combined, form a\nmanufacturing ecosystem. These technologies and solutions are referred to as\n\"enablers,\" since they aid in the optimization of the whole production process\nand, as a result, boost total profits.\n\nTo effectively provide high-quality goods and satisfy consumers, smart\nmanufacturing is redefining the whole manufacturing business by building on\nthe solid 4.0 framework and merging it with cutting-edge technologies such as\nArtificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Digital Twins, Predictive and\nPrescriptive analytics. This prompts the obvious question: what is all the\nuproar about smart manufacturing, and why is the future so precariously\npoised? With all of the promise that comes with it, businesses are naturally\necstatic. They see a means to boost productivity and produce a more trained\nworkforce, and they believe that their investment will pay off handsomely. How\nso? Smart manufacturing provides real-time data and insights that help\nbusinesses make better and faster decisions.\n\nAccording to research, 4.0 is the foundation for integrating physical and\ndigital manufacturing and realizing the full potential of smart manufacturing.\nThe value chain is becoming increasingly interconnected. Thus, if Industrial\nrevolution 4.0 was about shifting from reactive to predictive mode, smart\nmanufacturing takes it a step further.\n\n### **Industrial internet of things**\n\nThe industrial internet of things (IIoT) is a network in which every item,\nequipment, and/or process is linked through data transmission technologies.\nSensors are incorporated or connected in every machine and piece of industrial\nequipment, and these sensors often generate the necessary data. Through data\ntransmission technologies, this is then transported to cloud/software systems.\nThis massive volume of data has a wealth of information that, when analyzed,\ncan assist in finding specific flaws in the manufacturing process. After the\ndata has been analyzed, it is forwarded to the production systems as feedback\nfor any necessary corrections.\n\nHowever, implementing IIoT in existing and/or older organizations is\ndifficult, but it is possible in freshly built industrial facilities. This is\nbecause results can only be obtained if the smart manufacturing idea is used\nfrom the beginning of the production facility design process.\n\nFactories are still catching up to Industry 4.0, investing in resources and\ntechnologies such as:\n\n  1. Robotics and automation include collaborative robots in addition to the well-known Amazon warehouse robot. \"Cobots\" are programmed to operate alongside humans, who \"teach\" them what to do and in what sequence. The stages are then optimized using cobots to improve the results. In every industry, from automobiles and plastics to food and consumer products, automation is continually advancing.\n  2. Additive manufacturing (AM) and 3D printing \u2014 the 3D printing market is estimated to reach $35 billion by 2025, give or take a few billion, depending on who you ask.\n  3. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a potentially massive network of computers, equipment, and systems that \"speak\" to one another through the Internet by exchanging data. The smart home is an example of IoT in action, with connected appliances, HVAC systems, and security systems that can all be managed remotely from your device. (Or the voice orders of your three-year-old.).  \n  \nThe US Smart Manufacturing Leadership Coalition, a national coalition of\nmanufacturing businesses, research universities, and government labs, has come\nup with some astounding economic predictions for smart manufacturing:\n\n  * Factory safety incidents have decreased by 25%.\n  * An increase in the energy efficiency of 25% is possible.\n  * Water usage is reduced by 40%, and total operational efficiency is improved by 10%.\n  * Reduced time to market by 10%\n\nA manufacturing company's strategy and organizational culture must be\nsubstantially transformed in order to fully use its new direct customer\nrelationship and make the entire transition to an IIoT-enabled, customer-\ncentric, and service-oriented organization.

We believe this step will provide us the ability to aim\npersuasive contributions to international organizations searching for\ninnovation advancement partners in India.\n\nHence, it is with immense pleasure we hope to offer combined solutions based\non each company's cutting-edge technological expertise. Simelabs along with\nGoodbits and Logiticks aims to provide a larger platform for clients, both old\nand new, by combining domain, technology, and versatility into a single\npackage of solutions and products. Our ambition to develop a stronger brand\nidentity in India that would respond to different customer needs across all\nmajor pillars of technology is being advanced with this consolidation. All\nthree organisations will continue to use their brand identity, with Simelabs\nserving as the primary brand for future opportunities. The changes will go\ninto effect at the start of the financial year 2022-23.\n\nWe hope this consolidation will serve as a model and inspiration for other\ntechnology service providers in Kerala.\n\nWhat Simelabs plans to achieve through this step :\n\n  * **Expand research and development opportunities** for increased capabilities on all ranges of core competencies. We at Simelabs strongly believe that capability isn't always limited to a single department.\n  * **To gain a better distribution or marketing network** and gain a competitive advantage for a larger market share. Simelabs has decided to expand into different markets and thus merge with the Goodbits and Finlead Logiticks. This distribution or marketing network is expected to provide all three entities with a larger customer experience in time.\n  * **Diversifying services** by enhancing the existing services.  We believe, all three companies will be able to gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace by combining their services through consolidation.\n\n**Quotes:**\n\n**Prakash Bare, Chief Evangelist, Simelabs - **We are entering a period of\ncomputing that defies all boundaries and crosses all borders, in which\neverything interacts with everything else. It's a world where solutions matter\nmost, where size matters, and where our ability to align ourselves to function\nin a seamless manner to meet our customers' every technological need will\ndetermine our success. This very belief has made me believe in this next step\nand I can proudly say that we at Simelabs have been always enthusiastic about\ngrowing our organization into a world-class services organization from Kerala\nwith a special focus on end-to-end product development capabilities.\n\n**Derrick Sebastian, CEO, Simelabs: **It is my staunch belief that this merger\nwill bring about only positive changes for all parties involved. The increased\nresources will ensure that we are more capable of providing quality customer\nservice in all aspects, particularly in delivering the best partnership\nexperience to customers. Additionally, I believe this merging process will\noffer great and fulfilling career opportunities to all our employees, making\nthe company stronger and more competitive in the market.\n\n**Tom Antony, CTO, Simelabs: **Simelabs has always believed that innovation\nemerges in lockstep with the growth of client expectations and wants, or vice\nversa. As a result, I firmly believe businesses all over the world must\nconstantly innovate in order to meet the needs of their customers which is why\nI feel that this consolidation is only the beginning of a brighter future for\nus.\n\nNext  __\n\n### Simelabs' Indventr and the Prana foundation promote impactful\ncollaboration\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Robotic Process Automation(RPA) and Artificial Intelligence(AI) turns out to be an opening gambit in the organisation\u2019s digital transformation process.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Does RPA and AI influence Digital Transformation?\n\nVignesh Technology Analyst\n\nRobotic Process Automation(RPA) and Artificial Intelligence(AI) turns out to\nbe an opening gambit in the organisation\u2019s digital transformation process. RPA\nis a technology that allows organisations to automate tasks by watching the\nuser perform that task in the General User Interface(GUI) and thus performs\nautomation by repeating the same task in the GUI. It thus automates most of\nthe work in the organisation and reduces human labour by eliminating hideous\ntasks like gathering and sorting data and thus allow people to concentrate on\nmore important work. Artificial Intelligence(AI) is a branch of computer\nscience that builds smart machines which can perform processes like learning,\nreasoning and self-correction which are some of the characteristic features of\nhumans.\n\nRPA and AI together play an important role in digital transformation.\n\n## **Do we really need automation?**\n\nIn an IT organisation, all the processes are not smart and intelligent. Most\nof the processes are well-structured series of regular tasks which tend to be\ntime consuming and boring for any human being. Professionals in most IT\norganisations spend their most valuable time in managing the data rather than\nthe work involving more knowledge, reasoning and communication. Work caused by\nthis poor design is more time consuming, less efficient, can lead to\ninevitable errors, more work and thus increases the cost of doing business.\n\n## **Why RPA?**\n\nWith traditional automation methods, it requires manpower, time, effort and\nsubstantial cost. Companies need fast, cost-effective, less error-prone\nautomation methods. This is where RPA becomes more relevant.RPA can automate\nalmost all day-to-day repetitive tasks easily and more accurately than any\nhuman being. It uses a robot that mimics the interaction of humans with web\napplications, excel, web portals, sites and thus automates the task. By using\nRPA for managing the routine and repetitive tasks, it eliminates human errors\nsuch as lack of knowledge and tiredness, which reduces the errors and thus\nreduces the operational risk. In this way, it frees the employer to focus on\nmore important works which involve knowledge, reasoning and attending customer\nservices.\n\n##  **Benefits of RPA**\n\nThus RPA proves to be highly beneficial for any organisation. Some of the\nbenefits of RPA involves\n\n  * More productivity\n  * High accuracy\n  * More efficient\n  * Cost-effective\n  * Less error-prone\n  * Less time consuming\n  * Low operational risk\n  * Better customer experience\n\nRPA is applied in areas like financial services, human resources, insurance,\ntechnology, sales. RPA controls the flow of digital information and moves it\nacross applications. Thus RPA becomes the powerful tool of digital\ntransformation as it converts the repetitive tasks to a single task which\ninvolves no human effort.\n\n## **How does AI empower RPA?**\n\nRPA as discussed above has many benefits but it alone cannot bring success in\ndigital transformation. Though RPA promises to work tirelessly and\neffortlessly 24/7, it is only applicable theoretically. There are exceptional\ncases where RPA fails. We know that RPA can only handle repetitive tasks but\nwhat if there occurs some kind of interruption, unexpected events. These cases\nare complicated as it involves the routine task with some knowledge work and\nRPA alone can't handle this. These tasks require applying common sense, making\njudgements and self-correction. These kinds of work thus involve human\nintervention and it again makes things complex by involving human presence\nevery time. In Order to avoid this Artificial intelligence(AI) is used along\nwith RPA.\n\nAI is a technology that makes decisions about the data. The machine mimics\nhuman behaviour. Through object recognition, speech recognition, translation\nthey deal with vision speech and language and hence analyse them and make\npredictions based on this data. AI is changing the world and the lives of\npeople and bringing up a new platform for organisations to flourish their\nbusiness.\n\nBy using RPA and AI together, it can accelerate the pace of digital\ntransformation.\n\nNext  __\n\n### IPFS File Upload \u2014 using Moralis\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/digital-transformation-services/", "title": "Digital Transformation Services - Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Technology plays an important role in digital transformation and the key steps in establishing data transformation is choosing right digital services.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Digital Transformation Services\n\nDigital transformation does not deal with a one time program. It's an ongoing\nprocess where the company evolves, rebuilds and reinvent itself. Technology\nplays an important role in digital transformation where it moves from business\ninteractions to processes to build new models.

It involves the continuous process of modernisation and changes in every level of business. Mobile apps let you do it. Mobile apps have become a fundamental aspect of every business type from large corporations to small business and startups. They play a key role in taking your business and company to the next level.\n\n## **CLOUD, AN INTEGRATED ELEMENT OF DATA TRANSFORMATION**\n\nCloud computing is the first step towards digital transformation. Digital\ntransformation involves a lot of changing processes and we need a platform\nthat can cope up with these changes. By using technologies such as the cloud,\nwe can make processes more efficient. This helps your business by improving\nits infrastructure and providing in-built security. Your business needs a\nplatform which is secure and allows you to build new digital applications\neasily. It provides the available memory and the best backup protocol.\n\nCloud provides lots of features,\n\n  * Cloud computing allows the company to be flexible and provides required resources, platform and infrastructure.\n  * Cloud allows the company to be profitable ie cost-efficient. The organisation needs to pay only for the resources used.\n  * Cloud provides protection from threats such as data breaches, disasters and system shutdown. Cloud provides an effective backup and thus data remains safe and secure.\n  * Cloud provides a platform where they can build tests and deploy apps on different platforms.\n  * Cloud will pave the way for success in digital transformation and has turned out to be a silver bullet in digital transformation.\n\n## **IoT ACCELERATE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION**\n\nInternet of Things is a series of technological components which is vast and\naccelerates digital transformation. It is built on cloud computing and other\ndata-collecting sensors and makes instant and effective decisions to improve\nquality and reduce time and cost.\n\nIoT goes together with data analytics, where data provided is used to predict\nwhat happens in future. IoT is not only used to get machines connected up but\nit also enables things such as predictive maintenance and predictive\nscheduling. Smart connected products possess a lot of technological\ncapabilities which can be an advantage for the organisation. These products\ncommunicate with the organisations every time they are used and thus\norganisation gets an understanding of the product in live operation.\n\nI0T is driving digital transformation in following ways\n\n  * It opens up new business opportunities. According to the data set generated by IoT devices companies can understand the customer preferences and accordingly from the previous insights introduce new products. \n  * It increases efficiency and reduces cost. Combining the data insights and sensors, IoT can increase business efficiency through automation and this will allow you to cut off the cost and use your resources accordingly.\n  * It improves employee productivity. IoT can empower your staff and it makes your system accessible anywhere, anytime.

Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Advancing Diabetes Management with AI-Powered Health Apps\n\nDiabetes is a chronic condition affecting millions worldwide, with type 2\ndiabetes accounting for the majority of cases. Managing diabetes involves\nconsistent monitoring of blood sugar levels, adherence to medication\nschedules, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including diet and exercise.\nThese tasks can be overwhelming, but advancements in Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) are transforming how individuals and healthcare providers approach\ndiabetes management.\n\n## **How AI is Slaying Diabetes Management**\n\nAI-based applications are at the forefront of personalized healthcare. They\noffer real-time monitoring, actionable insights, and customized guidance,\nmaking it easier for individuals to manage diabetes effectively. These apps\nleverage AI algorithms to analyze complex data from various sources, including\nwearable devices, meal logs, and medical records. Here are some key features\nthat make AI-powered diabetes management apps invaluable:\n\n### 1\\. Personalized Meal Analysis & Recommendations\n\nAI apps can evaluate food consumption patterns, breaking down meals into\nnutritional components such as carbohydrates, fiber, protein, and glycemic\nindex. They provide tailored meal suggestions that help maintain stable blood\nsugar levels.\n\n### 2\\. Seamless Integration with Smart Devices\n\nIntegration with devices like Bluetooth-enabled glucose monitors and\nsmartwatches allows for automatic tracking of blood sugar levels, physical\nactivity, and vital health metrics. These insights empower users to make\ninformed lifestyle choices.\n\n### 3\\. Comprehensive Health Tracking\n\nAI-powered platforms can monitor exercise routines, BMI, water intake, and\nmedication adherence. Daily, weekly, and monthly progress charts help users\nunderstand trends and adjust their habits accordingly.\n\n### 4\\. Proactive Health Management\n\nApps often include features like reminders for medication, meals, hydration,\nand meditation, ensuring users stay on top of their health goals.\n\n### 5\\. Data-Driven Insights for Healthcare Providers\n\nAggregated data from these apps can help doctors and researchers understand\nbroader trends, leading to improved treatment strategies and better disease\nmanagement.\n\n* * *\n\n### **A closer look at our work.**\n\n## **Transforming Type 2 Diabetes Management with AI**\n\nBy leveraging advanced AI capabilities, seamless device integrations, and\nuser-friendly features, the app provides personalized guidance on food habits,\ndaily activities, and medication adherence. With tools like meal analysis,\nreal-time health tracking, and tailored recommendations, this solution\nredefines diabetes care, offering enhanced health outcomes and valuable\ninsights for both users and healthcare providers.\n\n### **Key Features of the App**\n\n**Meal Analysis****  \n**Users can share meal photos and details via a WhatsApp interface. The AI\nservice analyzes food consumption patterns, focusing on carbs, fiber, protein,\nand glycemic index.\n\n**Activity and Health Tracking****  \n**The app connects with Bluetooth-enabled glucose devices and smartwatches to\nmonitor exercise, BMI, water intake, and other metrics. Users can view daily,\nweekly, and monthly progress charts.\n\n**Personalized Recommendations****  \n**It suggests meals, provides fitness video tips, and tracks medication\nintake.\n\n**Smart Notifications****  \n**Users receive reminders for water intake, meals, meditation, and\nconsultations, helping them stay on track.\n\n**Comprehensive Health Diary****  \n**The app serves as a personal diary, encouraging users to monitor and improve\ntheir overall health\n\n###  \n**Why This App Stands Out**\n\nThe app significantly enhances diabetes management by delivering real-time\ninsights and personalized guidance tailored to individual needs. By helping\nusers maintain better control over their condition, it reduces the risk of\ncomplications and minimizes associated healthcare costs, ultimately improving\npatient outcomes and quality of life.\n\nIn addition to empowering users, the app aggregates valuable data insights\nthat aid healthcare providers and researchers in refining treatment protocols.\nIts scalable design also offers monetization opportunities through premium\nsubscriptions, integration with advanced health devices, and partnerships with\nhealthcare providers, making it a robust solution for both patients and the\nhealthcare industry.\n\n### **Tech Capabilities Behind the App**\n\nThe AI-powered diabetes management app leverages cutting-edge technologies to\nensure seamless functionality and an intuitive user experience. **Dialogflow**\ndrives natural language understanding, enabling users to interact with the app\nconversationally through platforms like WhatsApp. **OpenAI** integrates\nadvanced AI models to analyze food habits, generate personalized\nrecommendations, and provide actionable health insights based on real-time\nuser data.\n\nOn the development side, **Flutter** offers a robust framework for creating a\ncross-platform app with a visually appealing, responsive interface.\n**Provider** simplifies state management, ensuring efficient data handling and\nsmooth app performance. Meanwhile, **Python** serves as the foundation for the\napp\u2019s AI algorithms, powering data analytics, machine learning processes, and\nseamless integration with wearable devices, making this solution both\nsophisticated and user-friendly.\n\n### **The Future of Diabetes Management with AI**\n\nAI-driven diabetes management tools are reshaping healthcare by providing\nproactive, personalized, and data-rich solutions. They empower patients to\ntake control of their health while equipping healthcare providers with\nvaluable insights to enhance treatment outcomes.\n\nSimelabs\u2019 AI-based app is a testament to how technology can bridge the gap in\nchronic disease management, offering convenience, efficiency, and better\nquality of life for individuals living with type 2 diabetes.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Interested in building cutting-edge AI health solutions?**\n\nConnect with us at **Simelabs** to transform healthcare through innovative AI-\ndriven technologies.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

He had coined a new buzzword in the software community, which he\ndidn't realise at the time. It would go on to be the subject of a slew of\nacademic studies, debates, and panel discussions later on.\n\nCunningham explained how he came up with the technical debt metaphor years\nlater:\n\n\u201cWith borrowed money, you can do something sooner than you might otherwise,\nbut then until you pay back that money you\u2019ll be paying interest. I thought\nborrowing money was a good idea, I thought that rushing software out the door\nto get some experience with it was a good idea, but that of course, you would\neventually go back and as you learned things about that software you would\nrepay that loan by refactoring the program to reflect your experience as you\nacquired it.\u201d\n\nTechnical debt, like monetary debt, can accrue \"interest.\" The focus of this\nconcept is on the increasing difficulty of implementing changes later on,\nparticularly as a software project progresses through multiple phases. The\nlonger technical debt is ignored or unaddressed, the greater the likelihood of\nsoftware entropy.\n\nWhen the Scrum Team learns more about the problem it is trying to solve, there\nis also a kind of technical debt that is created invisibly. In comparison to\nthe solution implemented just six months ago, the Development Team may prefer\na different solution today. Alternatively, the Development Team may change the\ndefinition of \"Done,\" requiring rework in previous product increments.\n\n**According to the Scrum Guide:**\n\n  * The Product Owner is in charge of maximising the value of the Development Team's work.\n  * Product Owners accomplish this by managing the Product Backlog, which can be seen in the content and order of Product Backlog items.\n  * The Product Backlog is the only set of requirements that the Development Team will work on, and it should include everything that the product needs to be useful.\n  * Quality is never compromised by the Scrum Team.\n  * The engineering organisation or the Development Team determines what constitutes \"done.\"\n  * The Product Owner discusses Product Backlog items that are appropriate for achieving the Sprint Goal during Sprint Planning.\n  * Only the Development Team, on the other hand, selects the Product Backlog items that are required to meet the Sprint Goal.\n  * As new information becomes available, the Development Team adds new Product Backlog items to the Sprint Backlog as needed.\n  * Rework of previous product Increments may be required if the Development Team improves the definition of \"Done.\"\n\nAs a result, the Scrum Guide is purposefully ambiguous on who is responsible\nfor technical debt in order to foster collaboration and self-organization,\nbeginning with the Scrum values\u2014courage and openness come to mind\u2014and leading\nstraight to transparency and Scrum's inherent system of checks and balances.\n\nThere are a few tried-and-true methods for making this task more manageable:\n\n  1. Be open and honest about your technical debt. Make existing technical debt visible so that everyone is constantly reminded of the state of your code. Also, address technical debt at Sprint Review events on a regular basis so that stakeholders are aware of the application's status.\n  2. Code metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, code coverage, SQALE-rating, and rule violations can be used to track technical debt. (There are a variety of tools available for this.) At the very least, keep track of how many bugs there are.\n  3. Every sprint, pay down technical debt on a regular basis. Consider allocating 15 to 20% of the Development Team's capacity to refactoring and bug fixing each Sprint. (For more information, see 19 Sprint Planning Anti-Patterns.)\n  4. Ensure that all tasks related to dealing with technical debt are included in the Product Backlog\u2014Scrum does not allow for shadow accounting.\n  5. Adapt your definition of \"Done\" to reflect your understanding of product quality, such as by defining code quality requirements that help keep technical debt under control in the long run.\n  6. Create a standard procedure for dealing with experiments that introduce temporary technical debt in order to accelerate learning in a critical field.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDespite the fact that many companies are using Scrum to add high value to\ntheir projects, the formation of technical debt is still a possibility. The\nkey to managing debt is clearly defining and keeping the debt status\ntransparent, regardless of how efficient the teams are. In each splint of the\nproject, the entire team should work together to understand, measure, and pay\noff technical debt. The debt report should be an important part of the Splint\nreviews, and it should be addressed as soon as possible.\n\nTechnical debt is inherently present when considering addressing a dilemma in\na particular paradigm. It constantly leads to new qualifications and\ncompetence to uniform existing verdicts. As a result, dealing with technical\ndebt necessitates a concession. A showcase manufacturer with additional\nfeatures will not be able to achieve the long-term goal of organizational\nversatility. For example, a customer's additional components appear to be\ninflexible. As a result, in Scrum, the management of technical debt is the\nresponsibility of the Team member, demonstrating Scrum's integrated\nsafeguards.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies

Why is it important? - Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Companies rely on data ingestion to make better products, analyse market trends, sale and thus lead to better decision making.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Big Data Ingestion - Why is it important?\n\nEvery company relies on data to make its decisions-for building a model,\ntraining a system, knowing the trends, getting market values. Storing the data\nin different places can be a bit risky because we don't get a clear picture of\nthe available data in that company which could lead to misleading reports,\nconclusions and thus a very bad decision making. So it's important to move the\ndata from different sources and store it in a centralised location.\nInformation needs to be ingested for the digestion to take place. So a company\nmust understand the value of data ingestion and its related technologies\nbecause it can boost business value.\n\n## Data driven decisions for a better\n\nEveryone who is running a business wants it to be the best. How can you\nachieve them? The efforts to achieve them should begin with data. A company\nshould have as much data as possible to understand the customers, to predict\nthe market values, to refer to the sale. Moreover emerging technologies like\nmachine learning work in a very precise and efficient manner with the help of\ndata provided to them. Hence data plays a very important role in modern\ntechnologies and it serves as a backbone for every company. Nowadays most of\nthe companies are engulfed by the data floods and it is important to store and\nmanage this data. If these companies do not want to compromise its success,\nthey need to rely on data ingestion and thus the company could make better\nproducts, analyse market trends, and thus lead to better decision making.  \n\n## How can we define data ingestion?\n\n Ingestion means to take something or to absorb. As the word itself says Data\nIngestion is the process of importing or absorbing data from different sources\nto a centralised location where it is stored and analyzed. Data comes in\ndifferent formats and from different sources. So it is important to transform\nit in such a way that we can correlate data with one another.\n\nData can be ingested in real-time or in batches or a combination of two. If\nyou ingest data in batches, data is collected, grouped and imported in regular\nintervals of time. It is the most common type and useful if you have processes\nwhich run at a particular time and data is to be collected at that interval of\ntime. Groups may be formed based on logical ordering or some other conditions.\nIt is a more cheap and easier way of implementing ingestion.\n\nIf you ingest data in real-time, data is imported every time source emits the\ndata. It involves no grouping. It is useful when process where continuous\nmonitoring is required and hence it's quite expensive compared to batch\ningestion. When the combination is used, it balances the benefits of both\nmodes of ingestion where the batch ingestion gives the time-sensitive data and\nreal-time ingestion gives extensive views of data.\n\n##  Data Ingestion tools\n\nChoosing an appropriate tool for data ingestion is not an easy task and it is\neven more difficult if there is a large volume of data and the company is not\naware of the tools available in the market. With the help of the right tools\nmanaging data like importing, transferring, loading and processing data\nbecomes easier. These tools also help the companies to modify and format the\ndata for analysis and storage purposes. Companies should select the data\nsources, check the validity of each data and also ensure the safe transfer of\ndata to the destination. Most of the companies use ingestion tools developed\nby experts. Before choosing the data ingestion tool make sure that the tool\ngoes well with your current existing system. A person with no coding\nexperience can handle the tool.  \n\n## Features of an ideal data ingestion tool\n\nData extraction and processing: It is one of the important features. It\ninvolves the extraction of data and also collecting, integrating, processing\nand delivering the data.\n\nData Flow visualisation: It simplifies every complex data and hence visualises\ndata flow.\n\nScalability: Another feature is their ability to scale to hold different data\nsizes and meet the different needs of the organisation as they designed for\nextension.\n\nAdvanced security features: Many additional security features like encryption\nand security protocols like HTTP, SSH is provided by ideal data ingestion\ntools.\n\nMulti-platform support and integration: This feature allows us to extract all\ntypes of data from different data sources without affecting the performance of\nthe systems.\n\n## Top data ingestion tools\n\nSome top data ingestions tools include Apache Kafka, Apache NIFI, Apache\nStorm, Syncsort, Apache Flume, Apache Sqoop, Apache Samza, Fluentd.\n\nApache Kafka: It is an open-source streaming software platform which can\nhandle several events. It is created by LinkedIn and later on donated to\nApache foundation and is written in Scala and Java. The aim of this project is\nto provide unified, high throughput, low latency platform for handling real-\ntime data. Thousands of companies are built on Apache Kafka, some of them\ninclude Netflix, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Airbnb, The Newyork Times.\n\nApache NIFI: It is a data ingestion tool which supports the flow of data\nbetween the systems. It is a java program that runs within a java virtual\nmachine. It also provides some high-level capabilities like web-based user\ninterface, seamless experience between design, control, feedback and\nmonitoring, data provenance, SSL, SSH, encrypted content. It is highly\nconfigurable which can modify data even at run time.\n\nApache Storm: It is an open-source distributed real-time big data processing\nsystem. It has the capability of highest ingestion rate. It is simple and all\nmanipulations on real-time data are executed in parallel. Apache storm is\nleading among real-time data analytics. It is easy to set up and operate and\nit guarantees that every message will be processed at least once.\n\nSyncsort: It provides the software that allows the organisation to collect,\nintegrate, sort and distribute more data in less time with fewer resources and\nlower costs. It offers fast, secure, grade products. You can design your data\napplications and deploy them anywhere.\n\nApache Flume: It is used for efficiently collecting, aggregating and moving\nlarge amounts of log data. It is distributed, reliable and has a simple,\nflexible architecture based on streaming data flows. It uses a simple,\nextensible data model for an analytic application. It secures from any kind of\ndata loss and even in the case of any system component failure, data will be\ncompletely protected. It is possible to connect many data sources to gather\nlogs from multiple systems and can stream data into multiple systems.\n\nApache Sqoop: It is designed for transferring bulk data between Hadoop and\ndatabases. It helps to import databases to files in Hadoop Distributed File\nSystem. It generates Java classes which help you to interact with the imported\ndata. They have pre-built connectors which help to integrate with external\nsystems like MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle. They can combine structured data\nwith unstructured or semi-structured data in a single platform and thus\nenhance the existing analytics.\n\nApache Samza: It is a distributed stream processing framework which is\nconnected with Apache Kafka. It takes full advantage of Kafka's architecture\nand provides fault tolerance, isolation and stateful processing. It only\nsupports JVM language which does not have the same language flexibility as\nStorm.\n\nFluentd: It is an open-source data collection software which lets you unify\ndata collection for better use and consumption of data. It is simple but\nremains flexible. It can connect to many sources and outputs while keeping its\ncore simple. Many companies rely on fluent as it can connect up to thousands\nof server.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

What makes an NFT\nunique is its digital signature created by blockchain technology. It defines\nthe ownership of an asset that can be bought and sold for real money or\ncryptocurrencies. NFTs are not interchangeable as it represents unique assets\nowned by a specific person. It protects the metadata attached with the image\nrather than the visual data we see with our eyes, and where the actual value\nresides. CryptoPunks and CryptoKitties are some popular NFT collections.\n\nimage credit: NFT Cryptokitties\n\n### **What are the purposes of NFTs?**\n\nNFT creates new opportunities for artists and art platforms, motivates people\nto buy art pieces from NFT marketplaces, promotes copyright or originality of\ndigital assets. An NFT can also function as a ticket to events that adds value\nother than the value of art.\n\n### **What are the standards of NFTs?**\n\n  * **ERC-721**\n\nSet of rules for NFTs defining them in such a way to identify something\nuniquely. It is based on deploying a separate smart contract for every token\ntype or collection.\n\n  * **ERC-1155**\n\nSupports both non-fungible and fungible tokens. It can use a single contract\nto make various types of NFTs.\n\nimage credit: Altcoin Buzz\n\n### **What are the attributes of NFTs?**\n\n  * **Creator**\n\nCreator is the one who creates and mint the NFT. NFTs hold the wallet address\nof its creator.\n\n  * **Owner**\n\nOwner is the one who owns the NFT at a specific point in time.

With\nCOVID-19 on the rise in many nations, healthcare systems are desperately\nseeking to bolster their supply of ventilators to meet the volumes of patients\nrequiring mechanical ventilatory support. Low-cost, emergency ventilators and\nmultiplexing systems offer a solution to this rapidly evolving situation.\n\nProject Prana is a not-for-profit foundation which grew out of biomedical\nengineering efforts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the\nBrigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. The foundation is focused on creating device-\nbased and educational solutions to address the ventilator shortage worldwide.\nThey are operationalizing the individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator\nCapacity (iSAVE), a rigorously tested platform to multiplex ventilation while\nenabling patient-specific therapy in several nations worldwide. The validation\nof this system in ventilating two subjects simultaneously was recently\npublished in Science Translational Medicine.\n\nIndVentr, a consortium of three startup companies, is creating innovative,\nfrugal, easy to manufacture, emergency care ventilators for treating COVID-19\npatients. It is a nonprofit, crowdfunded and open-source program driven by the\ncorporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives of Sinergia Media Labs,\nIonics3DP, and Aruvii. They have completed functional prototypes of their\ndesigns INDVENTR-100, a BVM-based emergency resuscitator, and INDVENT-200, a\nfeature-rich pneumatic design, which addresses an affordable range of cost and\ncapability points.\n\n\u201cProject Prana and IndVentr will join forces to offer both low-cost\nventilators and multiplexing systems to markets in India and neighboring\ncountries.\u201d says Shriya Srinivasan, President of the Project Prana Foundation.\n\u201cThis effort is poised to equip and greatly expand the capacity of healthcare\nsystems in developing nations,\u201d says Khalil Ramadi, Vice President of the\nFoundation.\n\n\u201ciSAVE is a carefully designed and thoroughly tested ventilator sharing\nplatform which can quickly scale up the ventilator infrastructure around the\nworld which is currently under heavy challenge by the Covid-19 epidemic\u201d says\nSilji Abraham, SVP & Chief Digital and Transformation Officer at West\nPharmaceutical Services and an advisor of the IndVentr consortium. \u201cThis\ninnovative, frugal solution, which will cost less that Rs20,000 augments\nperfectly the solution space IndVentr has been focusing on.\u201d says Prakash\nBare, the project head at IndVentr.\n\nDonations to support the development and distribution are welcome at:\nhttps://shareyourfortune.org/causes/others/others-2\n\n## **About IndVentr Consortium**\n\nIndVentr is a consortium of three startup companies - Sinergia Media Labs\n(Located in Cochin Smartcity, Registered with Kerala Startup Mission),\nIONIC3DP (Chennai and Maker Village, Cochin), and Aruvii (Singapore). The non-\nprofit, crowdfunded, and open source program aims to create emergency care\nventilation solutions that are affordable, easy to use, effective for Covid-19\ntreatment, and quick to manufacture. The products being developed are a BVM\nBased emergency resuscitator - IndVentr100, and a more capable pneumatic\ndesign - IndVentr200.\n\nThe program is being supported by advisors, contributors and entities from\nIndia, Singapore, US and other parts of the world. Dr. Prahlad Vadakkepat,\nAssociate Professor at the National University of Singapore who specializes on\nfrugal innovations; Silji Abraham, SVP & Chief Digital and Transformation\nOfficer at West Pharmaceutical Services; Ramamurthy Pachaiyappan, an industry\nveteran and startup consultant based in Bangalore; form the advisory board of\nIndVentr.\n\nMore information on IndVentr can be found at: https://www.indventr.com\n\n## **About Prana Foundation**\n\nThe Project Prana Foundation is a US-based not-for-profit foundation which\ngrew out of biomedical engineering efforts at MIT and the Brigham and Women\u2019s\nHospital. The foundation is focused on open-source dissemination of medical\ntechnologies to alleviate healthcare burden during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThey are operationalizing the individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator\nCapacity (iSAVE), a rigorously tested platform to multiplex ventilation while\nenabling patient-specific therapy, in several nations worldwide.

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Discover how an AI-powered travel itinerary app is transforming luxury travel planning by generating personalized itineraries, optimizing routes, and integrating seamless booking options, ensuring a stress-free and exclusive travel experience", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Case Study | AI Powered Travel Itinerary App Transforming Luxury Travel Planning\n\nLuxury travellers seek personalized experiences and seamless planning when\norganizing their journeys. Efficiency, exclusivity, and convenience play a\ncrucial role in ensuring a smooth and enjoyable trip. Recognizing the growing\ndemand for an intelligent travel planning solution, a leading hospitality\ncompany that manages and operates executive terminals and offices at airports\nsought to develop an AI-powered mobile application. This application was\ndesigned to simplify itinerary planning by eliminating complexities and\nenhancing the overall travel experience for its users.\n\n### **Challenges in Travel Planning**\n\nTravelers often face several challenges when it comes to organizing their\ntrips. Many have to consult multiple sources to gather information about\ndestinations, accommodations, dining, and activities, which can be both time-\nconsuming and overwhelming. Despite the availability of travel planning\napplications, most lack an integrated solution that combines personalized\nitinerary generation with direct booking options. Furthermore, conventional\ntravel planning tools do not effectively leverage AI to understand user\npreferences and suggest tailored activities, dining choices, and\ntransportation options. Addressing these limitations was critical in\ndeveloping an innovative solution that simplifies and enhances the travel\nexperience.\n\n### **The Solution: AI-Driven Travel Itinerary App**\n\nTo overcome these challenges, an AI-powered travel itinerary app was developed\nto provide a seamless and personalized travel planning experience. The\napplication is designed to collect essential travel details from users,\nincluding their origin, destination, duration of stay, number of travelers,\ntrip purpose, budget, interests, and preferred activity level. By gathering\nthis data, the app ensures that every itinerary is uniquely tailored to the\ntraveler\u2019s preferences.\n\nUsing advanced AI algorithms, the application generates customized daily\nitineraries based on the user\u2019s inputs. The system considers various factors,\nsuch as the best routes to optimize time, highly rated restaurants, cultural\nor leisure activities, and exclusive experiences that align with the\ntraveller's interests. The AI dynamically adjusts recommendations based on\nreal-time data, such as weather conditions, local events, and seasonal\nofferings, ensuring that travellers receive the most relevant and up-to-date\nsuggestions.\n\nThe user interface of the app is designed to enhance usability and ensure an\nintuitive experience. The itineraries are displayed in an engaging tile\nformat, making it easy for travelers to view and navigate their plans. Users\ncan make modifications to their itinerary, allowing them to fine-tune their\nplans based on their preferences. The app also provides real-time\nnotifications and recommendations, keeping travelers informed about changes\nand alternative options that may enhance their experience.\n\nOne of the key differentiators of this AI-powered travel itinerary app is the\nintegration of direct booking links. Users can seamlessly book transportation\nservices, such as car rentals and chauffeur-driven vehicles, without leaving\nthe app. Additionally, integrated ticketing options enable travelers to\nreserve dining experiences, entertainment, and event tickets effortlessly. The\nAI-driven recommendations extend to exclusive experiences, helping travelers\ndiscover unique and personalized activities that elevate their journey.\n\n### **Business Outcomes & Impact**\n\nThe introduction of this AI-powered travel itinerary app has resulted in\nsignificant business outcomes and enhanced user satisfaction. By simplifying\nthe travel planning process, the application has increased user engagement and\nretention, as travelers appreciate the convenience of a one-stop solution for\ntheir itinerary needs. Furthermore, the app provides opportunities for revenue\ngeneration through strategic partnerships with ticketing and booking services,\nallowing businesses to capitalize on user transactions within the platform. By\npioneering AI-powered luxury travel planning, the hospitality company has\npositioned itself as an innovator in the industry, setting new standards for\nconvenience, efficiency, and personalized experiences.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nThe AI-powered travel itinerary app is revolutionizing luxury travel by\nproviding a comprehensive and intelligent trip-planning solution. By\nleveraging AI to generate personalized itineraries and integrating seamless\nbooking options, the application transforms how travellers experience and\norganize their journeys. This innovation not only enhances convenience but\nalso redefines the standards of exclusivity and efficiency in the travel\nindustry.

Tap the link to know more.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# How Can Artificial Intelligence (AI) Help HR Professionals Overcome Today's\nChallenges?\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that is shaping new business\nparadigms. It's a solution that automates and completes the majority of low-\nvalue HR tasks so that more attention may be focused on the strategic scope of\nwork. From recruiting to talent management, AI has the potential to\ndrastically improve the employee experience by processing massive amounts of\ndata quickly and accurately. In the era today, AI capabilities are climbing\nnew heights and driving the way we function.\n\nAny organization's performance is determined by how well people, processes,\nand technology work together to produce value at the lowest possible cost.\nArtificial intelligence aids in the automation of most back-office\ntransactional tasks, allowing for faster service delivery.\n\n### **Help employees with cognitive decision making**\n\nIt is human to make mistakes, but AI works with data. It's only normal to make\nmistakes while manually dealing with data from numerous teams and departments.\nWhen this data is combined with AI, however, you can develop plans and come up\nwith novel ideas to assist your personnel. Employees' mood patterns and\nanxiety levels can be detected using artificial intelligence. AI may give you\nthe knowledge you need to make a cognitive decision by regulating staff's\nphone chats with clients and the tone of their voice during these discussions.\nHR managers may utilise this data to make educated, data-driven choices\nregarding the welfare of their employees. Consider a choice on how often\nmembers of a certain team should take breaks.\n\n### **Better candidate experiences**\n\nApplying for any job may be difficult from the standpoint of the applicant.\nEspecially when they have to wait days for a response from their prospective\njob. Companies can, however, use chatbots to pre-set replies to frequently\nasked questions. As a result, candidates receive prompt solutions to any\nquestions they may have about the application process.\n\nEmployers frequently make the mistake of ghosting applicants instead of simply\ninforming them of their rejection. Interviewers can use chatbots to give\nfeedback to help applicants prepare for future interviews if they aren't\nchosen. This would put a positive spin on the entire process, resulting in a\nbetter applicant experience.\n\n### **Reduced errors**\n\nIn each business, payroll administration requires zero mistakes, total\naccuracy, and efficient operations. This is another HR sub-function that might\nbe the most time-consuming and stressful. You can help solve payroll anomalies\nwith the use of various algorithms and thereby eliminate human errors by\nconnecting your payroll administration with AI.\n\n### **Internal mobility and employee retention**\n\nHuman resource professionals may leverage AI technology to increase employee\nretention and internal mobility in addition to improving the recruiting\nprocess. With personalised feedback questionnaires and employee reward\nprogrammes, HR departments can analyse employee engagement and job\nsatisfaction more precisely than ever before. This is very beneficial for\ndetermining the overall requirements of employees. Certain AI systems can\nassess employee performance, identify the best candidate for promotion, and\npredict which employees are most likely to leave. Knowing this information at\nthe earliest helps HR professionals to take retention efforts before it\u2019s too\nlate, lowering employee attrition purposefully.\n\n### **Understanding Employee Referrals**\n\nAI is also helping HR teams better understand employee referrals by analysing\nthe types of candidates that employees are referring to and determining who\nrefers the most successful candidates. Additionally, AI may examine prior\nreferral performance data and determine when prospects that are comparable to\nsuccessful employees are being referred.\n\nAI empowers HR departments to improve the candidate and employee experience by\nautomating low-value, repetitive activities and freeing up time to focus on\nthe more strategic, creative work that HR teams need and want to do. Rather\nthan spending time managing every stage of the new employee onboarding\nprocess, such activities may be intelligently automated, allowing teams to\nfocus on more critical responsibilities like mentoring and receiving feedback.\nCompanies must use this information to increase employee engagement and\nretention.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAI-based HR interventions can assist HR practitioners to improve employee\nperformance and experience while also increasing staff productivity. AI-\npowered HR solutions can assess, forecast, and assist key stakeholders in\nmaking decisions. Adopt AI solutions that meet your business's needs and are\ncompatible with your company's culture, and create the necessary digital maps.\nAI will have a range of effects on employees in the future, and they will be\nable to claim a speedy and accurate client experience. As a result, it's\ncritical to concentrate on employee requirements and be aware of the potential\nimplications.\n\nPrivacy of HR data is also a significant issue in AI development. Employee\ndata must be safeguarded, and suitable governance procedures must be\nestablished when using AI-driven HR interventions. The rules should include\nnot only the general technological and data entry procedures but also a wide\nrange of legal issues.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Explore how extended reality helps in boosting your business to the next level with the rise in technology.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# 9 Extended Reality Business Apps for Industries for 2022.\n\nExtended Reality (XR) is a catchall term that refers to all computer-generated\nreal and virtual environments. It is divided into three categories:\n**Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR)**. All\nimmersive technologies enhance our perception of reality by blending the real\nand virtual worlds into a fully immersive experience. According to the study,\nmore than 60% of respondents believe XR will become mainstream in the next\nfive years. By 2026, the market for Extended Reality (XR) will have grown from\n33 billion dollars to 125.2 billion dollars. This means that users will get an\nimmense amount of experience while sitting on their couch at home, users can\nimagine themselves walking on the moon or diving into the deep sea.\n\nTo learn more about Extended Reality, we must first comprehend its three\ncomponents: Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality\n(MR).\n\n**AR**\n\nAR enhances our perception of the real world by superimposing computer-\ngenerated information on top of what we see. This technology is now widely\nused in smartphone augmented reality apps that require the user to hold their\nphone in front of them. The app can display contextual information or deliver\ngaming and social experiences that appear to be rooted in the real world by\ntaking the image from the camera and processing it in real-time.\n\nWhile smartphone augmented reality has come a long way in the last decade, its\napplications are still limited. These days, wearable smart glasses are\nincreasingly being used to deliver a more holistic AR experience. These\ndevices must combine an ultra-low-power processor with multiple sensors,\nincluding depth perception and tracking, all in a light and comfortable form\nfactor that can be worn for long periods of time.\n\nWhile Google Glass was the first device to demonstrate this category in 2012,\nthe technology required to deliver a long-term solution is maturing, but more\nprogress is still needed. However, Microsoft HoloLens 2 is already\ndemonstrating how useful AR can be in the workplace in enterprise and\nindustrial applications.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2021, a number of new smart glasses models are expected to hit\nthe market, including Snap's Spectacle smart glasses, Lenovo's ThinkReality\nA3, and Vuzix's Next-Gen Smart Glass.\n\n**VR**\n\nA user's view is completely replaced by VR, which immerses them in a computer-\ngenerated virtual environment. This type of XR technology has been around for\na while, with improvements over time. It's primarily used for entertainment\npurposes, such as gaming, concerts, movies, or sports, but it's also making\ninroads into the social realm. Virtual reality is also used in training,\neducation, and healthcare, such as rehabilitation. The focus of VR technology\nis often on high-quality video and rendering, as well as ultra-low latency, to\nmake these experiences possible (and also seamless) for the end-user.\n\n**MR**\n\nAs the real and virtual worlds merges, MR falls somewhere between AR and VR.\nThis type of XR technology can be used in three different ways. The first is\nvia a smartphone or AR wearable device that superimposes virtual objects and\ncharacters onto real-world settings, or vice versa.\n\nThe Pok\u00e9mon Go mobile game, which debuted in 2016, uses a smartphone camera to\noverlay virtual Pok\u00e9mon in real-world environments (this was also demonstrated\non a HoloLens 2 as shown at Microsoft Ignite 2021). This game is often hailed\nas a game that revolutionises augmented reality, but it's actually a great\nexample of mixed reality (MR), which combines real-world environments with\ncomputer-generated objects. Mixed reality is also being used to superimpose\nvirtual reality real-world players into video games, bringing real-world\npersonalities to game streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube.\n\n**Medical Sector**\n\n**1\\. XR can improve wellbeing**\n\nMindfulness and meditation have been shown to have a positive impact on\noverall health and well-being. As a result, a slew of meditation apps has\npopped up to assist people in meditating and de-stressing, many of which use\nsoothing sounds and guided instructions. Some of these solutions now include\nvirtual reality (VR) to make guided meditations even more immersive.\n\nOne such app is Guided Meditation VR. It includes over 100 pre-made\nmeditations in stunning virtual environments such as a beach, a secluded\nforest, and even the top of a mountain. Meanwhile, soothing audio instructions\nlead you through a variety of breathing exercises. If you've struggled with\nmeditation because you can't tune out the outside world, putting on a virtual\nreality headset and using a virtual reality meditation app could help you\nliterally block out everything. I can definitely see the advantages of this.\n\n**2\\. Effective visualisation of data through XR**\n\nNow let's look at an example of augmented reality. AR is ideal for visualising\nmedical information because it overlays digital images and information onto a\nreal-world view. For example, overlaying anatomical data onto a patient in\nreal life. This can aid clinicians in performing procedures more quickly and\naccurately.\n\n**Retail**\n\nSmartphones have improved their ability to process augmented reality (AR)\ncontent over the last ten years. As a result, brands have discovered a wide\nrange of applications for AR. Nintendo's massively popular Pokemon Go game,\nwhich debuted in 2016, is widely credited with bringing AR into the\nmainstream.\n\nMany large retailers are now experimenting with AR and other forms of XR to\nimprove shopping experiences. IKEA was one of the first retailers to embrace\nthis technology, releasing the IKEA Place app in 2017 to allow customers to\nvisualise furniture in their homes before purchasing it.\n\nLuxury brands have jumped on board as well. In July 2020, for example, Gucci\npartnered with Snapchat to allow potential buyers to virtually try on shoes.\nUsers could then \"buy\" the shoes or simply share photos of them \"at their\nfeet\" with their social media followers. A strategy designed to not only\nmitigate the impact of lower foot traffic in stores since Covid-19, but also\nto engage Gen-Z buyers in the future.\n\nExtended reality can improve the emotional value of a retail experience by\nallowing for more detailed storytelling. This was recently demonstrated by\nLouis Vuitton in its ready-to-wear Spring 2021 show, which combined virtual\nreality with a live stream of the catwalk. The goal was to give viewers in the\naudience and at home a rich emotional and artistic experience.\n\nIf we imagine a future in which high-street stores can safely remain open, XR\nhas a place there as well. Businesses can use AR and holograms to not only\nprovide a contactless experience for visitors, but also to leave a lasting\nimpression and collect data on them.\n\n**Education**\n\nPrior to COVID-19, most countries' education sectors were lagging behind in\nadopting new technology due to a lack of funding and a fear of change.\nHowever, global educational technology investment increased to $4.5 billion in\nthe first half of 2020, with much of it going to higher education. XR began to\nappear as a teaching modality for university-level curricula, alongside\ndistance learning and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs).\n\n**Security  **\n\nCommercial surveillance systems are ineffective. Security personnel in control\nrooms may have access to multi-tiered maps that show information about the\npremises or camera locations. That information, however, is not available to\nall security officers. On-the-ground personnel who require that information\nthe most must rely on their Security Operations Center colleagues. Maps are\nfrequently inaccurate. Even if security officers deliver accurate information,\nthere's a good chance it will be misinterpreted.\n\nOn-the-ground security personnel can use AR glasses to effectively communicate\ntheir security needs in real time, making facilities more secure. Instead of\nrelying on verbal information from colleagues, security personnel can receive\nreal-time updates, allowing them to respond more quickly.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nExtended Reality has a wide range of applications and could be used in a\nvariety of industries, including retail, real estate, marketing, training,\nentertainment, and more.

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Exploring different methods for increased customer attraction through virtual reality and other reality technological methods.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# How Virtual Reality will attract more online customers in 2022\n\nExploring different methods for increased customer retention and customer\nattraction through virtual reality and other reality technological methods.\n\n### **Maintaining customer to business strategy**\n\nConverting a new customer is an exciting prospect. Despite that, many\norganizations underestimate the difficulty of disregarding the valued clients\nthey already have and focusing the majority of their marketing efforts on\nrecruiting rather than customer retention. According to research, retaining an\nexisting client is roughly 5 times less expensive than acquiring a new one.\nMany customer-experience strategy talks start with a faulty assumption. People\nfrequently use the terms 'customer' and 'consumer' interchangeably. While\nclient and consumer may refer to the same group of people in some situations\nand often fail to recognize the key differences between these two commonly\nused terms. When businesses consider the competitive advantages of becoming\nmore customer-centric, they frequently focus on interactions with retail\nbuyers or end-users. However, in our opinion, a customer-centric mindset is\njust as important in the B2B arena, and an increasing number of executives are\nbuilding B2B customer-experience strategies that are yielding impressive\nresults. Customer retention is not only cost-effective, but it's also a\nwonderful branding exercise for delighting your customers and turning them\ninto brand ambassadors \u2014 if they like you, they'll tell others about you.\n\nYour customers are perhaps the most crucial component of your business,\nregardless of what industry you're in or what items and services you sell.\nThere are almost no sales without the customer. As a result, they are an\nimportant consideration when creating marketing communication and strategy.\nIt's likely that your marketing campaigns will fail if you don't consider the\nperspectives of your customers. The goal of client retention activities should\nbe to remind past customers how wonderful and helpful you are. Adopt \"show,\ndon't tell\" and \"serve, don't sell\" in this endeavor. When you do both,\nclients know you're looking out for their best interests.  Clients may have\nappreciated your service, but unless you make an effort to stay on their\nminds, they will forget. Make it a priority to stay in touch and provide value\nif you want your business to thrive.\n\n### **AR/VR Technology in business**\n\nBusinesses always maintain their growth phase through the right strategies.\nAnd they simply cannot happen without technology. Undoubtedly, creating\nmultiple realities using technology and merging with the physical one has\nalways been a good way to gain customers. There is a fundamental mismatch\nbetween the quantity of digital data at our disposal and the actual world in\nwhich we apply it. While the reality is three-dimensional, the rich data we\nnow have to inform our judgments and actions are still confined to two-\ndimensional pages and screens. It helps the customers have a better sense of\nhow the products would be once they try them on without physically doing so.\nEducation, architectural and urban design, digital marketing and activism,\nengineering and robotics, infotainment, virtual communities, fine arts,\nhealthcare and clinical therapies, heritage, and anthropology, occupational\nsafety, social science, and psychology are just a few of the domains where\napplications have been developed. Unlike typical user interfaces, VR immerses\nthe user in an experience, allowing them to interact with the 3D world rather\nthan simply viewing a monitor screen in front of them. Technology has\nrevolutionized the world by simulating as many senses as possible, including\nvision, touch, hearing, and even smell. Furthermore, teachers in a variety of\neducational sectors are increasingly turning to virtual reality technology to\nassist them to give a higher grade of education. The technology also provides\npupils with a more visual and engaging education, which may be delivered at a\nreduced cost. In recent years, virtual reality technology has carved out a\nniche in the game industry.\n\n### **Virtual fitting**\n\nProgressive Ecommerce projects will begin to aggressively introduce virtual\nreality technologies, mainly virtual fitting, in 2022. Customers will find\nthis process considerably more convenient given that the majority of business\nis done online. This will assist customers in making purchasing decisions.\nAugmented reality mirrors, for example, allow consumers to \"try on\" preferred\ngarments or shoes without really wearing them. While virtual fitting solutions\nare popular in apparel and footwear businesses, they will soon be offered in\nfurniture, makeup, glasses, and accessories stores as well.\n\n### **VR for Real Estates**\n\nVR technology will play a critical role in democratizing the real estate\nindustry. This allows potential home or apartment buyers to take a virtual\ntour of the property. The Softengi real estate app is the best example. This\nenables retailers to create accurate models of a house or apartment and invite\ncustomers to virtually visit them using a VR headset. The model is made from\nan under-construction house or apartment that can be remodeled.\n\n### **In-Store Navigation**\n\nThanks to Augmented Reality navigation, customers will be able to easily\nnavigate a large shopping mall and find the right product. The vast majority\nof augmented reality in-store navigation takes the form of a mobile app. These\napps can do much more than just provide users with an AR routing by leveraging\nadvanced programming language features such as Python try-catch. AR-enabled\ntechnology can recommend a more efficient shopping route, show the exact\nlocation of the desired item, and even direct customers to discounts and gift\nsections. Lowe's, one of America's leading home improvement retailers, uses an\nin-store navigation app to overlay directional prompts and make customers'\nshopping more convenient.\n\n### **Virtual Reality of travel sector**\n\nVirtual reality is quickly becoming a potent marketing tool. As a result,\ntravel companies are incorporating virtual reality technology into their\nmarketing plans. This technology provides more options for travel agencies,\nhotels, and other tourism-related businesses to provide realistic interactions\nwith the services they offer. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has opened up\nnew avenues for the expansion of VR tourism. VR can be used as a marketing\ntool as well as an \"alternative travel\" option for tourists who are unable to\ntravel. Virtual reality is also expected to play an important role in the\ntourism sector's post-pandemic recovery.\n\n### **Virtual reality for in-store experiences.**\n\nWith COVID-19 still wreaking havoc on the industry and the future looking\nbleak, an increasing number of eCommerce businesses will turn to virtual\nreality to attract customers.

Enter Low-Code \u2014a game-changing\napproach to software development that enables both technical and non-technical\nusers to build robust applications with minimal hand-coding.\n\n### **What\u2019s the Hype About Low-Code ?**\n\nLow-code development platforms allow users to create applications visually\nthrough drag-and-drop interfaces, pre-built modules, and templates, reducing\nthe complexity and time associated with writing complex code. These platforms\nprovide a range of components like logic, workflows, integrations, and user\ninterfaces that can be customized to meet specific business needs.\n\nWith low-code, applications that traditionally took months or even years to\ndevelop can now be built in a matter of weeks, with fewer resources. This\ndemocratizes software development, empowering business analysts, project\nmanagers, and other non-developers to take part in the process without\nrequiring a deep understanding of programming languages.\n\n### **Why Low-Code is a Game Changer** ?\n\nLow-code platforms are revolutionizing software development by enabling\naccelerated development cycles. Through rapid prototyping and a significant\nreduction in manual coding, they allow for shorter development timelines and\nfaster deployment of applications, supporting quicker go-to-market strategies.\nThis efficiency benefits businesses seeking to stay competitive with faster\niterations and real-time adjustments to applications.\n\nIn terms of cost efficiency, low-code platforms reduce the need for extensive\ndeveloper resources and help cut down on long-term maintenance expenses. With\nbuilt-in security, testing, and cloud integrations, these platforms lower the\noverhead typically associated with traditional development. Moreover, low-code\npromotes collaboration between business and IT teams, allowing non-technical\nusers to participate in the design of workflows and interfaces. This co-\ncreation model empowers business stakeholders and IT professionals to work\ntogether seamlessly, enabling developers to focus on more complex tasks.\n\nLow-code platforms also provide agility and flexibility, essential for\nthriving in today\u2019s fast-paced market. With the ability to quickly adjust\napplications to changing business needs\u2014whether updating workflows or adding\nnew features\u2014businesses can pivot efficiently without major rewrites.\nAdditionally, many low-code solutions support cross-platform compatibility,\nmaking it easy to develop applications once and deploy them across web,\nmobile, and desktop environments with minimal additional effort.\n\n### **How People Are Using It**..\n\nLow-code platforms are transforming business operations by enabling rapid\ndeployment of automation and customer-facing applications. With capabilities\nfor automating repetitive tasks like data entry and approval workflows, these\nplatforms streamline business processes and enhance productivity. They are\nalso ideal for creating customer portals, self-service applications, and\nmobile apps, ensuring a seamless user experience that integrates smoothly with\nexisting backend systems.\n\nAdditionally, low-code solutions facilitate legacy system modernization and\nrobust data management. By integrating new functionalities, organizations can\nenhance outdated systems without the need for full infrastructure\nreplacements. Low-code platforms also support real-time data insights through\ncustom dashboards and reporting tools, empowering businesses with critical\ninformation for informed decision-making.\n\n### **The Real Talk on Challenges**\n\nWhile low-code offers numerous benefits, it\u2019s not without its challenges.\nOrganizations need to consider the scalability of low-code applications. While\nthese platforms work well for small to medium-sized projects, more complex\nenterprise-level applications may require custom development and deep\nintegrations that go beyond the scope of low-code platforms. Additionally,\nvendor lock-in is a concern. Companies must evaluate the long-term viability\nof their low-code platform, ensuring that it will meet future needs and allow\nfor flexibility as technology evolves.\n\nFinally, governance and security must be carefully managed. While low-code\nplatforms often include built-in security features, it is essential for\nbusinesses to ensure that proper oversight and controls are in place to\nprotect sensitive data.\n\n### **The Future of Low-Code**\n\npredicts that by 2025, 70% of new applications developed by enterprises will\nuse low-code or no-code technologies, up from less than 25% in 2020. The rise\nof low-code is transforming the way businesses innovate, making software\ndevelopment more accessible, cost-effective, and agile. As low-code platforms\ncontinue to evolve, we can expect greater integration with artificial\nintelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies. This will allow for\nsmarter applications that can adapt to user behaviour and provide predictive\ninsights, further enhancing the capabilities of low-code solutions.\n\nLow-code is revolutionizing the software development landscape, providing\nbusinesses with the tools to innovate rapidly while keeping costs down.\nWhether you\u2019re a small startup looking to launch your first product or a large\nenterprise seeking to modernize legacy systems, low-code offers the\nflexibility, speed, and collaboration needed to succeed in today\u2019s digital-\nfirst world.\n\n* * *\n\n**Ready to accelerate your digital transformation with low-code development?\nDon\u2019t wait\u2014empower your team to build faster, collaborate better, and stay\nahead of the competition.

Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Flutter vs. Kotlin | Which One\u2019s Gonna Slay Your Next App?\n\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced world of mobile app development, choosing the right\ntechnology stack is crucial for ensuring the success and sustainability of\nyour project. With an array of tools, languages, and frameworks to choose\nfrom, narrowing down the best fit for your needs can be a challenging task.\nAmong the numerous contenders, Flutter and Kotlin have risen as two of the\nmost popular and effective solutions for mobile app development.\n\nWhile Flutter offers a unified approach for building cross-platform apps,\nKotlin is a powerful language tailored specifically for Android development.\nIn this comparative analysis, we\u2019ll dive deep into the strengths and\nweaknesses of each, guiding you towards making an informed decision for your\nnext mobile app venture.\n\n## Flutter | **A Cross-Platform Champion**\n\nFlutter, developed by Google, has quickly become a favorite among developers\nfor its ability to create native-like apps not only for iOS and Android but\nalso Web Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), Windows, macOS, Linux,\nEmbedded Linux (e.g., Raspberry Pi, ARM-based devices), Fuchsia (experimental)\nand Custom Embedded Devices (community-supported), using a single codebase.\nThis reduces the need for separate development efforts for each platform,\nsignificantly cutting down time and resources. Key Features :\n\n**Hot Reload****  \n**Flutter 's hot reload feature is a game-changer for developers, allowing\nthem to instantly see the results of changes in the code without needing to\nrestart the app. This speeds up the development process, making bug fixes and\nUI adjustments seamless and efficient.\n\n**Customizable Widgets****  \n**One of Flutter\u2019s standout features is its extensive library of pre-designed\nand customizable widgets. These widgets allow developers to craft beautiful\nUIs with ease, giving them the flexibility to design unique and engaging user\nexperiences for any application. This has control over every pixel of the\ndevice using low level apis\n\n**Dart Programming Language****  \n**Flutter uses Dart, a modern and easy-to-learn object-oriented language\ndeveloped by Google. Dart offers clean syntax, strong performance, and is\ndesigned to cater to both front-end and back-end needs, making Flutter apps\nfast and scalable.\n\n**High Performance****  \n**Flutter\u2019s architecture is built around a highly optimized rendering engine,\nensuring smooth animations and responsive interfaces. Since Flutter compiles\nto native machine code, it performs comparably to fully native apps,\ndelivering a consistent and high-quality user experience.\n\n## Kotlin | **A Modern Language for Android Development**\n\nKotlin, created by JetBrains, has emerged as the officially supported language\nfor Android development, replacing Java in many modern projects. Designed to\nsolve many of Java\u2019s shortcomings, Kotlin offers a clean, efficient, and\nexpressive syntax that enhances the productivity of Android developers. Key\nFeatures:\n\n**Seamless Java Interoperability****  \n**One of Kotlin 's most significant advantages is its ability to seamlessly\nintegrate with Java code. This makes it an ideal choice for teams looking to\nenhance or refactor existing Android apps built in Java, as Kotlin can be\ngradually introduced without rewriting the entire codebase.\n\n**Coroutines for Asynchronous Programming****  \n**Coroutines are one of Kotlin\u2019s most powerful features, simplifying\nasynchronous programming and allowing developers to write clean, non-blocking\ncode for tasks like network calls, file I/O, and database access. This\nimproves app responsiveness and makes it easier to handle concurrency.\n\n**Functional Programming Constructs  \n** Kotlin embraces functional programming paradigms, such as higher-order\nfunctions and lambda expressions, allowing developers to write more concise\nand expressive code. This not only improves readability but also reduces the\nlikelihood of errors.\n\n## **Choosing the Right Language for Your Project**\n\nDeciding between Flutter and Kotlin boils down to your project\u2019s specific\nrequirements, team expertise, and long-term goals. Here are a few\nconsiderations to help guide your decision:\n\n  1. **Development Time and Budget:  \n** If you need to develop a cross-platform app that works on both Android and\niOS, Flutter can save time and effort by using a single codebase. However, if\nyou\u2019re solely focused on Android development, Kotlin might be the more\nefficient option. Moreover flutter module can develop and easily integrate to\nexisting native apps.  \n\n  2. **Existing Codebase and Ecosystem:  \n** For teams that already have an Android app built in Java, transitioning to\nKotlin is a natural progression due to its interoperability with Java. You can\nincrementally adopt Kotlin without having to refactor the entire codebase.  \n\n  3. **Team Expertise and Preferences:  \n** Consider your team's familiarity with Dart (Flutter\u2019s language) or\nKotlin/Java. Training costs and learning curves may play a role in your\ndecision. Teams well-versed in Android development might prefer Kotlin for its\nalignment with the Android ecosystem, while teams aiming for cross-platform\ncapabilities might lean towards Flutter.  \n\n  4. **User Experience and Custom UI Needs:****  \n**If you need to deliver a highly polished user experience with extensive\ncustom UI designs, Flutter\u2019s rich widget library and robust rendering engine\noffer tremendous flexibility and performance. Kotlin, on the other hand, is\ngreat for Android apps where platform-specific UI features are a priority.\n\n## **Showdown**\n\nBoth Flutter and Kotlin are exceptional choices for mobile app development,\neach with its own strengths and ideal use cases. Flutter is perfect for teams\nlooking to build cross-platform apps quickly, leveraging a single codebase for\nboth iOS and Android. Its fast development cycle and rich UI components make\nit a strong contender for modern app development.\n\nOn the other hand, Kotlin shines in Android-specific projects, offering\nseamless Java interoperability, null safety, and powerful asynchronous\nprogramming capabilities. It provides developers with the tools they need to\nwrite clean, efficient, and reliable code. The best choice ultimately depends\non your project\u2019s unique requirements, your team\u2019s expertise, and the\nplatforms you\u2019re targeting.\n\n## **Let Us Guide You to the Right Solution**\n\nAt Simelabs, we understand the intricacies of mobile app development and the\nimportance of choosing the right technology stack for your business. Whether\nyou're looking to build a cross-platform app with Flutter or optimize your\nAndroid development with Kotlin, our team of experts can guide you through the\nentire process.\n\n**Contact us today** to explore the best approach for your project and ensure\nyour app's success!\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/tag/digital-ecosystem/", "title": "digital ecosystem Archives - Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# digital ecosystem\n\n##  How is Intelligent Connectivity Shaping the Future of Digital\nTransformation?\n\nMarch 3, 2025 9:10 am\n\nTechnology is no longer working in silos;

A recommendation engine is a data filtering tool\nthat uses machine learning algorithms to suggest the most relevant content to\na certain user or client. It works on the premise of identifying patterns in\ncustomer behavior data, which may be gathered either implicitly or explicitly.\nTo give some famous examples,  Netflix's movie and programme recommendations\nare based on a recommendation engine. Amazon, on the other hand, utilizes a\nrecommendation engine to provide product recommendations to its users. While\neach utilizes one for somewhat different reasons, the end aim is the same: to\nincrease sales, increase engagement and retention, and provide more tailored\ncustomer experiences. In the past, a salesman or friends and family would make\nsuggestions. Today, we've entrusted this duty to algorithms' hands, or minds.\nYou might argue that these robots are well-trained in the art of up-selling\nand cross-selling as a marketing strategy.\n\nRecommendation engines are made feasible by two methodologies: content-based\nfiltering and collaborative filtering (CF). Both methods have advantages and\ndisadvantages, and none is ideal, which is why many high-end manufacturers\nutilize a \"hybrid\" engine that blends the two. However, each strategy is\neffective in achieving a certain purpose; it all relies on the company's\ngoals, needs, and skills.\n\n### **Content-Based Filtering: Keywords in Edgewise**\n\nThe first strategy, content-based filtering, is the more straightforward of\nthe two. It's built on the idea that items that are connected have keywords in\ncommon, which the recommendation engine can look up in the database to\nidentify more stuff with the same keywords. This is in stark contrast to\ncollaborative filtering (discussed in the following section), in which the\nengine connects or perceives elements in the database as similar based on\nprevious user activity.\n\nContent-based filtering, which is powered by keywords rather than community,\navoids the \"cold start issue\" that plagues CF engines. To begin suggesting, a\ncontent-based engine doesn't need to collect data; all it needs to know is how\nthe organization has pre-classified each item. Furthermore, if keywords are\nwell-researched and original, the engine can consistently deliver relevant\nmaterial that buyers will enjoy. Changes in incoming data or client behavior\nare unlikely to lead the engine to propose anything irrational or humiliating\n(which can be caused by external market forces or cultural trends). Content-\nbased filters are stable and consistent, and suggestions will not change until\nkeywords change.\n\nHowever, this approach's lack of dynamism is also a disadvantage. It's easier\nto maintain a recommendation engine that isn't impacted by the activities of\nthe individuals who use it. However, it generates less timely, accurate, and\nvivid suggestions by default. Everything boils down to keywords using this\nstrategy. A corporation may study and whiteboard its keywords from here to\nKalamazoo, attempting to account for every conceivable link one thing could\nhave to others; yet, active users are far more likely to make new and more\ninteresting connections based on their real activity.\n\n### **Collaborative Filtering**\n\nThe process of collaborative filtering is based on collecting and evaluating\ndata on user activity. This involves tracking the user's online behavior and\nforecasting what they would enjoy based on their shared interests.\n\nThe following are two types of collaborative filtering techniques:\n\n  * Collaborative filtering between users\n  * Collaborative item-by-item filtering\n\nOne of the key advantages of this recommendation system is that it can provide\nexact recommendations for complicated objects without having to understand the\nobject. There is no reliance on material that can be analyzed by machines.\n\nRecommender systems are software programmes that employ a variety of\nmethodologies to produce and deliver suggestions for objects and other things\nto users. Hybrid recommender systems integrate two or more recommendation\nalgorithms in a variety of ways to take advantage of their synergistic\nbenefits. The state of the art in hybrid recommender systems over the previous\ndecade is presented in this thorough literature review. It is the first\nquantitative study devoted only to hybrid recommenders. We discuss the most\nimportant issues that have been explored, as well as the data mining and\nrecommendation strategies that have been utilised to solve them. We also look\nat the hybridization classes that each hybrid recommender falls into, as well\nas the application areas, the assessment procedure, and future research\npossibilities. According to our findings, the majority of research weight\ncollaborative filtering with another approach. Cold-start and data sparsity\nare the two typical and top difficulties addressed in 23 and 22 research,\nrespectively, although majority of the writers continue to employ movies and\nmovie datasets. Providing more reliable and user-oriented assessments remains\na common difficulty because most research are appraised by comparisons with\nsimilar approaches using accuracy measures. Newer issues, such as reacting to\nchanges in user context, evolving user tastes, and delivering cross-domain\nsuggestions, have also been discovered. Hybrid recommenders, as a popular\nissue, provide an excellent foundation for responding appropriately by\ninvestigating fresh prospects such as contextualizing suggestions, using\nparallel hybrid algorithms, processing bigger datasets, and so on.\n\n### **Which Method Is Better?**\n\nRecommendation engines are an important arrow in the modern marketer's and\nsalesperson's quiver. What is the best method for constructing one? Both\ncontent-based and collaborative filtering have advantages and disadvantages,\nbut the transition from one to the other is simple.\n\nCompanies may start automating right away using a content-based filtering\nengine that operates on predetermined keywords, rather than waiting for a\ncommunity to build data patterns. This level of personalisation can be\nbeneficial if the keywords are excellent. It does, however, prevent unexpected\nand unique connections from arising between goods and ideas.\n\nMeanwhile, a CF-powered engine will take longer to become operational since\nits predictive analysis is reliant on user behavior, which must first occur.\nIt also needs more constant monitoring, as fresh data is always arriving. More\ndata, on the other hand, translates to sharper, more engaging, and more\ndiversified suggestions, which is crucial for converting knowledgeable\nconsumers who want deep customisation.\n\nTo learn more check out our further blog.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Exploring on the need for high-quality data in the new era of wealth management. Tap the link to know more.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Role Of Data Analytics In Wealth Management\n\nThe financial crisis of 2008-2009 shook the financial industry to its core,\ndriving corporations to become more adaptable than ever before. With the rise\nof data analytics, the need to manage an ever-increasing volume of information\nwhile responding quickly to market shifts and regulatory requirements presents\nchallenges for wealth management firms, particularly in the face of rising\noverhead costs, shrinking IT budgets, and customer demands for greater\npersonalization.\n\nThe amount of data produced each year is increasing at an exponential rate. In\nthe last two years, more data has been produced than in the whole history of\nhuman mankind. According to a September 2015 blog article by Forbes technology\nwriter and big data specialist Bernard Maar, around 1.7 gigabytes of\ninformation will be produced every second for every individual in the world by\n2020. To be competitive, organisations must organise, understand, and act on\ndata in real-time, while the volume of data grows exponentially. Business\nexecutives' capacity to recognise patterns in a vivid, pictorial context is\nenhanced by data visualisation approaches. It also enables them to detect and\ncomprehend significant connections as well as recognise fresh chances.\n\nThe visualisation of data in a clear, visual context that helps consumers\nbetter comprehend and absorb the relevance of the data is known as data\nvisualisation. Using digital visualisation tools to study data and track key\nperformance indicators allows you to stay on top of your clients and peers.\nManagers, sponsors, and sales teams may more effectively plumb the data and\nunderstand how to use it using digital visualisation approaches. Managers, for\nexample, may want to know how productive their sales teams are, while sponsors\nmay want to know how widely their data is distributed across managers. One\ncentral database allows various users to access the same information in ways\nthat match their needs by allowing diverse audiences access to the same\ninformation.\n\nAccording to Investopedia's affluent millennial poll, financial advisers are\nthe most trusted source of investing advice for roughly 65 percent of\nmillennials. The public's exposure to the newest data management advances has\nincreased the volume and complexity of data. As a result, data management and\nmining become more complicated. This clearly demonstrated a variety of\nadvantages that the data visualisation process may provide, such as:\n\n  * For an accurate \"big picture\" view of customer demands and financial trends, derive insights from structured and unstructured data sources.\n  * Predict customer behaviour and investment trends using sophisticated predictive analytics.\n  * Have a transparent sense of operational status in the business.\n  * By making regulatory compliance more efficient, you can save money and streamline your operations.\n  * Data from any system can be integrated and delivered in real-time.\n  * To make custom-tailored offers, gain a better understanding of customer preferences.\n  * Provide interactive reports and analysis tools via dynamic web and mobile portals.\n  * Customers should be able to self-serve their accounts from any device.\n\n### **Predictive Analytics for Business Growth**\n\n\"Big data and advanced analytics are on the verge of transforming the wealth\nmanagement industry, with new ways to engage with new clients, manage client\nrelationships, and manage risks,\" according to Deloitte. The industry is\ntransitioning from insight to foresight \u2013 from knowing what is happening to\nanticipating what may or will occur. Predictive analytics can help a good\ncompany become even better, and a great company becomes even better.\n\nAdvanced analytics has an impact on every stage of the customer acquisition\nfunnel and relationship today:\n\n  * Getting New Clients: Create comprehensive prospect profiles, map relationships, identify new markets, and generate better leads using( internal and external data.\n  * Sales to new and current clients: You may develop Net Worth and Share of Wallet profiles, calculate a client's potential lifetime worth, and assess risk tolerance for various types of funds and advise by linking transaction and channel data with market events.\n  * Client Recommendations: Client surveys and other data sources are used to tailor portfolio allocations and provide real-time trade/investment ideas based on preferences and market events. Enhance Q&A capabilities and human-to-machine communication channels.\n  * Existing Client Supervision: Compare personality and investment profiles with investment and trading activities on a regular basis to assess the suitability of wealth management approaches in order to keep each client optimally positioned.\n  * Client Retention: Gather and compare client channel and social data to stay informed about their current satisfaction, risk tolerance, interests, and connections, resulting in increased retention and referrals.\n\nCompanies utilise predictive analytics at every stage of the funnel to measure\nand implement crucial business results and key drivers such as client\nsegmentation, advisor books, and product penetration, as well as to evaluate\nthe acceptance and efficacy of tools and processes.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWealth managers continue to face a variety of industry dynamics, from\nincreased regulation to new digital delivery channels, shifting wealth\ndemographics to fee pressure, and now cyber security threats. Firms are\nlaunching new initiatives to stay competitive and compliant, such as rolling\nout alternative investment products and creating a single client identifier.\nThese advancements increase data volume and complexity, making data\nmanagement, maintenance, and mining more difficult.

Ordering food online, buying online,\nmaking payments online, booking tickets online, getting news updates, you name\nit, there's an app for everything. Despite having mobile-friendly websites,\nmobile applications are thought to bring more traffic and income since the\namount of material consumed in an app is more than in a browser. There's no\ndoubting that businesses who want to give the greatest possible consumer\nexperience today must use mobile platforms. Customers nowadays anticipate\nthis. So, what happens when a company adopts mobile applications? This\nphenomenon is termed Enterprise mobility.\n\nEmployees may connect to critical procedures and activities even when they\naren't at their desks thanks to enterprise mobility. Enterprise software that\ncan be used from a mobile device enhances the employee experience and boosts\nteam productivity. As a result, corporate mobility is an essential part of\ndigital transformation. The importance of mobile applications in digital\ntransformation cannot be overstated.\n\n  1. **Increased efficiency and productivity**\n\nBy speeding up procedures and simplifying operations, digital technologies\nimprove efficiency and production. For example, robotic process automation can\nbeat humans by several factors. IBM demonstrated bots that did jobs 20 times\nquicker than humans and made fewer mistakes than humans. Humans cannot collect\nand analyse data as quickly or accurately as business intelligence\ntechnologies and data analytics systems can. Workers then utilise the data to\nmake faster judgments than they could without the aid of smart technology.\n\n  2.  **Brand Visibility**\n\nYour brand will be recognised at the top of consumer options if the business\napp is created in a way that serves the purpose and meets customer demands.\nEven if your company has a strong internet presence, consider developing an\napp to reach out to a wider audience. With a mobile app, your brand will\nappear on the screen every time your consumer unlocks his or her phone or\ntablet. This is a very efficient technique to grow your consumer base while\nincreasing your brand's visibility.\n\n  3. **Workflow Optimization**\n\nUsing mobile software platforms, businesses may track their performance and\ndiscover where they can improve. To eliminate human error, businesses may use\nworkflow optimization tools to automate the repetition of mundane tasks and\ncreate predetermined rules. Furthermore, workplace mobile applications may\nincrease productivity, reduce mistakes, save time and money, and more by\nprioritising and organising work tasks and projects utilising boards, lists,\nand cards. Project Management Apps make it easier to exchange data,\ncollaborate with many users, and monitor projects and tasks, all of which\nimprove workflow.\n\n  4. **Mobile geo-targeting (marketing & sales). **\n\nWith the emergence of beacons and geo-targeting, \"targeting important users\nwith location-specific, time-sensitive messaging via mobile applications has\nbecome easier.\" Businesses may provide unique offers to consumers who are\nclose to stores, for example, by incorporating geo-location technology into a\nmobile application.\n\nSmall businesses can save money, limit their focus, and provide tailored\nadverts to customers at the correct time and place by employing this strategy.\n\n  5. **Unique offers**\n\nAnother strategy to expand your business with mobile applications is through\noffers and launches. Customers' searches, forthcoming festivals, cashback\noffers, discount coupons, and other factors may all be used to produce offers.\nInforming your regular clients about deals or new launches via SMS, emails, or\napp updates will make them ready to buy. Customers who are pleased with their\npurchase will tell their friends and family about it, which will help the\ncompany succeed.\n\n  6. **Easily accessible content**\n\nWe all know that content is king on the internet and mobile applications that\nare easy-to-understand and accessible material are always valued more. Even if\nan app is merely a learning or information portal with no sales, the material\nshould be legitimate and easily accessible to gain popularity among users.\n\n  7. **Enhance customer experience**\n\nBy analysing client journeys, providing tailored messaging, sending\npersonalised push alerts, and more, mobile applications help businesses better\nengage with consumers. Customer service has been transformed by mobile\napplications and chatbots, which provide consumers with quick responses to\ntheir concerns or demands. In summary, integrating mobile applications into\nbusinesses increases the whole customer experience significantly.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThese are just a few of the many advantages that mobile applications provide\nto businesses. Mobile apps may help not only large corporations, but also\nsmall businesses and startups. It is preferable to use mobility to digitally\nalter essential business operations. By researching market trends and industry\nrequirements, you may determine the breadth of mobile apps.

Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# RAG | Enhancing AI's ability to access and process information.\n\nIn today\u2019s rapidly advancing world of artificial intelligence (AI), the pace\nof innovation is both exhilarating and relentless. As AI continues to evolve,\nit\u2019s not enough for companies to simply keep up with emerging\ntechnologies\u2014they must actively lead the charge, continually seeking out and\nmastering the most advanced tools available. This is especially true in a\nlandscape where the demands for smarter, more efficient, and contextually\naware systems are higher than ever. The ability to harness the full potential\nof these cutting-edge technologies is what distinguishes industry leaders from\nthe rest. It's about more than just adopting the latest innovations; it\u2019s\nabout integrating them into real-world solutions that deliver tangible value,\nwhether through improved user experiences, enhanced regulatory compliance, or\noptimized data management.\n\nOne of the most promising technologies to emerge in recent years is Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation (RAG), a sophisticated AI architecture that marries the\nbest of both retrieval-based and generative models. By combining these two\napproaches, RAG allows for the creation of AI systems that are not only\nintelligent but also remarkably accurate and contextually relevant. This dual\ncapability is what sets RAG apart from traditional AI models, making it a\ntransformative force in the field. At Simelabs, we\u2019ve recognized the\ntransformative potential of RAG early on and have been at the forefront of its\nimplementation across various projects. Our commitment to innovation has\ndriven us to explore how RAG can be applied to enhance user interactions,\nstreamline complex regulatory processes, and improve the accessibility and\naccuracy of data. By leveraging RAG, we\u2019re not just responding to the\nchallenges of today\u2019s AI landscape\u2014we\u2019re setting new standards for what\u2019s\npossible, pushing the boundaries of AI to create solutions that are smarter,\nmore efficient, and more aligned with the needs of our clients.\n\n## **What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?**\n\nRAG is an AI architecture that combines the strengths of retrieval-based\nsystems with generative models to provide highly accurate, contextually\nrelevant responses. The concept revolves around integrating a retrieval\nmechanism that pulls in relevant information from a large dataset or knowledge\nbase and feeding it into a generative model like GPT (Generative Pre-trained\nTransformer). This architecture is particularly effective in scenarios where\nthe accuracy of information and context is paramount.\n\nTraditional generative models, while powerful, sometimes struggle with factual\naccuracy, especially when dealing with specialized or domain-specific\nknowledge. RAG addresses this by first retrieving the most pertinent data and\nthen using this data to generate responses, ensuring that the output is both\ncontextually aware and factually correct.\n\n## **Case Study 1 : Streamlining Regulatory Compliance with RAG**\n\nNavigating regulatory compliance in the pharmaceutical industry presents a\nunique set of challenges. The process is often intricate and labor-intensive\ndue to the varying timelines, procedures, and requirements imposed by\ndifferent countries. Recognizing the need for a more efficient approach,\nSimelabs developed a solution utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nto automate and streamline the reporting of Individual Case Safety Reports\n(ICSRs) and other safety information.\n\n### **Challenges**\n\nThe pharmaceutical sector faces a myriad of regulatory hurdles, largely driven\nby the diverse requirements that differ from one country to another. These\nrequirements can vary based on several factors, including the stage of the\nproduct (pre-marketing or post-marketing), the type of product (drugs,\nvaccines, biologics, etc.), and the nature of the reporting (expedited,\nperiodic, or risk management). Additionally, pharmaceutical companies must\nadhere to strict timelines for report submissions as stipulated by regulatory\nbodies, adding to the complexity of compliance.\n\n### Benefits\n\nThe implementation of RAG in our regulatory compliance solution brings several\nkey benefits. The automation of data collection and structuring significantly\nreduces manual effort and minimizes the potential for errors, enhancing\noverall efficiency. By ensuring that companies meet regulatory requirements\nacross different countries and product types, our solution supports rigorous\nadherence to compliance standards. Moreover, the provision of data through a\nREST API makes critical regulatory information readily accessible, enabling\npharmaceutical companies to maintain compliance effortlessly. Through the\napplication of RAG, Simelabs has successfully streamlined the regulatory\ncompliance process, offering a solution that meets the complex demands of the\npharmaceutical industry with greater precision and ease.\n\n## **Case Study 2 :CartGPT \u2013 Revolutionizing E-commerce with RAG**\n\nAt Simelabs, our commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI technology is\nexemplified in our flagship project, CartGPT. This sophisticated chatbot\nrepresents a transformative application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) within the e-commerce sector. Built using OpenAI models and leveraging\nthe power of RAG, CartGPT is designed to provide an unparalleled user\nexperience by seamlessly interacting with product catalogs.\n\n### **Advanced Search Capabilities**\n\nCartGPT stands out for its advanced search capabilities, which are central to\nits functionality. The chatbot is capable of handling a diverse range of\nsearch types, enabling users to find exactly what they need with remarkable\nspeed and precision. This functionality is a direct result of RAG\u2019s ability to\nretrieve and present the most relevant information from a vast product\ncatalog, enhancing the efficiency of the search process.\n\n### **Contextual Product Suggestions**\n\nOne of the key strengths of CartGPT is its ability to provide contextual\nproduct suggestions. By deeply understanding user queries through RAG, CartGPT\ncan offer product recommendations that are highly relevant to individual\nneeds. This capability not only improves the accuracy of the suggestions but\nalso enriches the overall shopping experience, making it more personalized and\nengaging for users.\n\n### **Accurate Information Retrieval**\n\nAccuracy in information retrieval is a crucial aspect of CartGPT\u2019s\nfunctionality. By leveraging RAG, the chatbot ensures that every response is\nboth accurate and contextually relevant. The RAG architecture allows CartGPT\nto draw from an extensive dataset within the product catalog, ensuring that\nusers receive reliable information in real-time.\n\n### **Impact**\n\nThe implementation of CartGPT has significantly transformed user interactions\nwith e-commerce platforms. The chatbot\u2019s advanced capabilities, powered by\nRAG, enable it to not only understand but also anticipate user needs. This\nresults in a more intuitive and enjoyable shopping experience, where users can\ninteract with the platform in a way that feels both natural and intelligent.\nCartGPT\u2019s success highlights Simelabs' expertise in applying RAG to enhance\nAI-driven solutions, setting a new standard for e-commerce interactions.\n\nThrough CartGPT, Simelabs has demonstrated the transformative potential of\nRAG, showcasing how this technology can revolutionize user experiences and\ndeliver significant advancements in the e-commerce sector.\n\n  \n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Digital transformation is not a matter of new technologies. It starts with people who build business with right digital technologies. Learn more!", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Does Digital Transformation cut out people?\n\nIf you consider digital transformation as a matter of new technologies, you\ndon't have a clear picture of digital transformation. Who deals with new\ntechnologies implemented in your organisation? Who does marketing in your\norganisation? Who calls and deals with clients? Who solves the queries of\ncustomers? It's the employees in your organisation and the digital\ntransformation starts with these people.\n\nZiglar quoted about the deep relation between business and people where he\nsaid It's impossible to build a business alone. Instead, we should build\npeople first and these people build the business. To run a business and drive\ndigital transformation, technology is a crucial element. So technology plays\nan important role in any organisation and digital technology does replace\npeople efforts in many ways. But it's not everything about technology. There\nis an important factor which holds everything together, whose brains work\nbehind these technologies, who are capable enough to work in any environment\nand capable enough to communicate with the customers. These are the employees\nof the organisation who drive the digital transformation in an efficient\nmanner. Though we have many factors which affect the digital transformation\nand every factor plays an important role in the digital transformation\nprocess, the people factor is a special case where on advancing the people\nfactor it, in turn, advances the other factors.\n\n##  **Does digital technology replace people?**\n\nWe have seen many new developing technologies like cloud, apps, automation,\nartificial intelligence which are built to reduce human effort and to\ndigitally transform the organisation. These technologies reduce the hectic\ntasks but every technology needs human intervention. Technologies can never\nreplace people. What they rather do is augmenting the capabilities of people.\nSo in order to achieve success in the long term, we should maintain a balance\nbetween technology and people so that they work together and the collaborative\nintelligence helps in achieving greater goals for the organisation. What if an\norganisation replaces people with technology? Will there be more profit? It's\nan absolute no because in the short term it may or could improve the benefits\nof the organisation but when we consider long term there won't be any future\nfor this organisation.\n\n##  **Artificial Intelligence and people**\n\nArtificial intelligence is also dependent on people as it boosts the strength\nof people's capabilities. In Artificial Intelligence, people should play some\ncrucial roles that include training, illustration and preservation. You must\nhave heard about training where training involves teaching machines how to\nperform the tasks they were assigned to do. Apple\u2019s Siri, Amazon\u2019s Alexa are\nsome of the valuable donations in the field of artificial intelligence and\nthese required human trainers to bring human touch and spirit in these devices\nand it was indeed a great achievement in this era. Illustration involves\nexplaining the use and behaviour of these machines to the users. Lastly, we\nhave assistance which involves sustaining Artificial Intelligence. It ensures\nthat AI is working properly and also ensures the safety of the people. It\nmakes sure that AI does not harm humans in any way. Organisations could earn\nbenefits from this collaboration and must understand how machines and humans\ncan augment the strengths of each other.\n\n##  **An organisation should invest more on people**\n\nHumans can connect with humans better than any machines. They understand\nemotions, feelings and have the ability to think and thus could understand the\nqueries of customers and could interact with clients in an efficient manner.\nMoreover, people possess different talents which could be an asset and provide\na lively feeling for the organisation. People have emotions and thus their\ncommitment towards the company creates loyal employees. Most of the\norganisations require skills and smart working strategies which most of the\ntechnologies do not possess. These scenarios force the organisation to invest\nmore in human capital. Organisations should mould the capabilities of the\npeople so that they could fit in with the needs of the organisation.\n\nMoreover, digital transformation involves continuous changes and humans should\nbe able to adapt to these changes. So the organisation should ensure that\npeople are given enough time and knowledge so that they can cope up with the\nchanges.\n\n##  **Do you value your employees?**\n\nEmployees should be given enough freedom to introduce new ideas, strategies,\ntechnology to your organisation so that they feel being a part of the\norganisation and thus can keenly work on every aspect. Once they take starting\ntheir own decisions they feel more responsible towards the organisation and\nthus could be more productive. Organisations should put their trust in the\nemployees and should make them feel they are an important part of this\norganisation.\n\nAnswer their queries. Let them make decisions. Listen to their perspectives.\nThey need their hard work to be recognised and feel that they have brought\nsuccess to the company. Explain the project and the goals that need to be\nfulfilled and make them a part of this mission and make them understand what\nrole they play in this. People consider these things more than money.\n\nSo people are an important and inevitable part of any organisation. Even if\ntechnology reaches the extreme heights where there are millions of robots, you\ncan\u2019t ever replace the human spirit and their intelligence. It's always the\nmost necessary or unavoidable part of the organisation. By giving them a voice\nin your organisation, moulding their capabilities in the right manner and\nenhancing more communication with them can lead the company to greater\nheights.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Digitization of diary supply chain - Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Optimal solution for digitization of diary supply chain in India. Provides various actionable insights to improve the diary supply chain efficiently.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Stellapps\n\nOptimization solution for diary supply chain by getting data driven and\nactionable insights\n\nDigitization is playing an important role in the business world. Digitalizing\nthe organisation can provide you with a competitive advantage among other\norganisations by doing things better, faster and cheaper than others.\nStellapps is a project which was started to digitize the dairy supply chain in\nIndia and also provides various actionable insights to improve the diary\nsupply chain efficiently.\n\n## Why digitization?\n\nThe global milk production has increased over the years and is expected to\nincrease 2% per year in the coming days. But due to the increasing population\nand pervasive movement of people away from rural farming has created a\nchallenge in the case of the dairy industry. This can cause the industry to\nfraught with many difficulties like inefficiency, deterioration of dairy\nproducts, unsatisfactory quality of the commodities and mismatch of demand and\nsupply.\n\nIn this emerging market where we face a lot of problems, there is a strong\nneed for technology and this technology acts as a driving force in bridging\nthe intelligence and the efficiency gap. Digitization helps to unlock many\nunknown values on a large scale.\n\nIn every dairy industry, there are mainly 3 processes which involve milk\nproduction, milk procurement and cold chain management. These processes are\ntaking place in different sites and is difficult to keep a tab on every site\nand every process. It is important to keep track of every information\navailable in order to understand the areas to progress. Tracking details never\ncame into practice in traditional dairy farming as tracking down every detail\nin an analog manner is quite strenuous. So digitization played a major role in\nthis by collecting a wide variety of data from various sites and send the\ncollective data over a network.\n\n## What do we do?\n\nAfter milk production and procurement comes to the cold chain management which\ninvolves storing the milk in a temperature-controlled environment. Cold chain\nmust be carefully monitored and managed in order to produce high-quality milk.\nFrom the moment the milk is procured it has high risk of bacterial\ndevelopment. So it is important to maintain it at a particular temperature to\nprevent bacterial growth. Any breach in the cold chain can affect the quality\nof the milk in a drastic manner like it affects its texture, taste, ph value\nand can turn into useless. The cold chain involves bulk machine for cooling\nand chilling milk. Many automated operations take place in these machines.\nWithout proper management, it can cause neglected operations and hence affect\nthe working of these machines. It thus affects dairy products also.\n\nEvery machine has got inbuilt sensors like temperature sensor, humidity\nsensor, volume sensor which sends live data and hence makes it possible for\nreal-time analysis. With this data we could determine the state of the\nmachine, the current status of the milk, amount of milk in the machine, the\ncurrent temperature and humidity, whether the machine is on or off and thus\nevery detail regarding the machine. Now with this complete data available, the\nmachine is monitored efficiently from a remote space with the help of the\nInternet of Things which helps to transfer data over a network. With the help\nof this remote monitoring system, the received data is stored and hence the\ncomplete history is tracked and these values are provided in a graphical\nmanner on the dashboard. So whenever things go wrong, authorities are\ncompletely aware of it.\n\n## Outcome\n\nThis project has already reached its heights. It is of great use in our Indian\ndairy industry as we are the greatest producers and consumers of milk and it\nis really needed to ensure the quality also. So with this system of\ndigitization, we can monitor, control and ensure better care of the products.\n\n## Discover more by clicking on stellapps\n\n**STELLAPS**\n\n## Technologies Used\n\nNext  __\n\n### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/tag/cloud-resources/", "title": "cloud resources Archives - Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# cloud resources\n\n##  Don't Waste Your Money in the Cloud!\n\nAugust 4, 2024 12:17 am\n\nHere's How to Control Costs..

Accelerating Research and Development**\n\nIn an industry driven by innovation, research and development (R&D) is key to\nstaying ahead of the curve. Generative AI can supercharge R&D by offering new\nways to explore materials, simulate physical behaviors, and predict outcomes.\n\nFor instance, GenAI models can help discover new semiconductor materials with\nbetter electrical properties, potentially leading to more energy-efficient\nchips. Additionally, AI can assist in simulating how different design\napproaches will affect chip performance, allowing companies to iterate quickly\non new ideas and bring groundbreaking products to market faster.\n\n## **Benefits of Generative AI in Semiconductors**\n\nGenerative AI offers significant advantages to the semiconductor industry by\nenabling faster innovation and enhanced operational efficiency. One of the\nprimary benefits is the **accelerated time-to-market** , where AI-driven tools\nautomate design iterations and simulate production processes, drastically\nreducing the development cycle. This allows semiconductor firms to stay\ncompetitive in a fast-paced market. Additionally, AI-generated designs\noptimize for factors like performance, power, and space constraints, leading\nto more complex and efficient chip architectures, boosting overall chip\nfunctionality and performance.\n\nGenerative AI also enhances **production efficiency** by predicting and\npreventing manufacturing defects, reducing waste, and optimizing resource\nutilization. Cost reduction follows naturally as AI automates labor-intensive\ntasks such as design, testing, and verification. The technology also supports\ninnovation in **R &D** by discovering new materials and optimizing energy\nconsumption, leading to greener and more sustainable semiconductor products.\nLastly, AI-driven supply chain optimization enhances the industry's resilience\nby providing better demand forecasting and real-time risk management.\n\n* * *\n\n**Generative AI is poised to be a game-changer in the semiconductor industry.\nBy automating design, optimizing manufacturing, enhancing supply chains, and\naccelerating R &D, GenAI is enabling semiconductor companies to keep pace with\nthe growing demands of the digital age. The integration of AI into\nsemiconductor workflows not only boosts efficiency and innovation but also\nsets the stage for the future of intelligent hardware. As the semiconductor\nindustry evolves, companies that harness the power of Generative AI will be at\nthe forefront of delivering the next generation of chips that power our AI-\ndriven world.**\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Discover how immersive VR and AR training solutions are revolutionizing precision manufacturing. Learn how these technologies enhance workforce efficiency, improve safety, and reduce training costs while providing a risk-free, hands-on learning experience.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Case study | Immersive VR Training for Precision Manufacturing\n\nIn today\u2019s fast-evolving industrial landscape, businesses are increasingly\nturning to innovative technologies to enhance workforce training and\noperational efficiency. Among these advancements, Augmented Reality (AR) and\nVirtual Reality (VR) have emerged as game-changers, offering immersive and\ninteractive training experiences that go beyond traditional methods.\n\n## The Need for Advanced Industrial Training Solutions\n\nIndustries such as manufacturing, oil & gas, automotive, and healthcare face\nunique challenges in training their workforce. Traditional training methods,\nwhich often involve classroom-based learning and on-the-job training, can be\ntime-consuming, costly, and sometimes risky. AR and VR provide a safer, more\nefficient, and cost-effective solution that helps workers acquire hands-on\nexperience in a controlled virtual environment before stepping into real-world\nscenarios.\n\n## How AR and VR Transform Industrial Training\n\nOne of the primary advantages of VR in industrial training is the ability to\nprovide fully immersive environments. Trainees can practice complex procedures\nin a risk-free setting, allowing them to gain hands-on experience without the\npressure of real-world consequences. For example, in the oil and gas industry,\nworkers can simulate high-risk operations such as equipment maintenance or\nemergency response, reducing potential hazards while enhancing skill\ndevelopment.\n\nOn the other hand, AR offers real-time guidance by overlaying digital\ninformation onto the physical world. Workers can receive step-by-step\ninstructions and visual cues while performing tasks, leading to improved\naccuracy and efficiency. In manufacturing settings, AR can be used to guide\nassembly line workers through intricate processes, minimizing errors and\noptimizing production workflows.\n\nImplementing AR/VR-based training programs also contributes to significant\ncost savings. By shifting training from live environments to virtual\nsimulations, companies can avoid shutting down production lines, reducing\ndowntime and operational disruptions. This approach leads to lower training\ncosts by eliminating expenses related to travel, equipment wear and tear, and\ntrainer fees.\n\nAnother key benefit of AR and VR technologies is their ability to standardize\ntraining programs. Regardless of geographic location, employees can access the\nsame high-quality training experience, ensuring consistency in skill levels\nand operational standards across an organization. This helps businesses\nmaintain quality control and regulatory compliance while fostering a culture\nof continuous learning.\n\nAdditionally, AR/VR training solutions provide valuable data-driven insights\nfor organizations. By tracking trainees' performance, companies can identify\nskill gaps, monitor progress, and tailor training programs to individual\nneeds. This data-centric approach enhances workforce competency and prepares\nemployees for future challenges.\n\n## **Case Study**\n\n## Immersive VR Training for Precision Manufacturing\n\nAt Simelabs, we have successfully implemented AR/VR training solutions for\nvarious industries, including the medical equipment sector. One such project\ninvolved developing a Virtual Reality training program for operators working\nwith machinery used in the production of critical medical equipment, such as\npliers and stoppers. This innovative training solution leveraged immersive VR\nsimulations to enhance operational efficiency, improve safety, and ensure\nprecision in manufacturing processes.\n\nThe VR training program featured lifelike 3D models of production machinery,\nenabling operators to engage in hands-on learning without the constraints of a\nphysical environment. Through interactive modules, trainees were able to\npractice operating, troubleshooting, and maintaining complex equipment in a\nvirtual setting. The program provided a risk-free environment, eliminating the\nsafety hazards associated with live machinery training.\n\nFurthermore, the VR training solution incorporated performance tracking\ncapabilities, offering real-time feedback and assessments to enhance learning\noutcomes. By monitoring trainees' progress, the system helped identify areas\nfor improvement and allowed for personalized training experiences. The\nsolution addressed key challenges faced by WEST Pharma, which required a\nconsistent and effective training approach to overcome operational costs,\nsafety risks, and limited equipment availability during live production.\n\nThe VR training program was developed for multiple platforms, including Oculus\nQuest 2, PC, iOS, and Android, ensuring accessibility and flexibility for\ntrainees across different locations. By adopting this innovative solution,\nWEST Pharma was able to eliminate risks associated with live machinery\ntraining, accelerate the learning curve for operators, and reduce downtime and\noperational costs linked to training on physical equipment.\n\nTo develop this cutting-edge solution, ASTEK utilized a range of advanced\ntechnologies, including VR, Photon, Unity 3D, AWS, 3DS Max, and Maya. Our\nexpertise in these technologies allowed us to create an immersive and\neffective training experience tailored to the specific needs of our client.\n\n## Challenges and Future Prospects\n\nDespite the numerous benefits of AR/VR training, organizations may encounter\nchallenges such as high initial investment costs, content development\ncomplexities, and the need for specialized hardware. However, advancements in\nAR/VR technology, including more affordable and lightweight headsets, cloud-\nbased training platforms, and AI-driven personalization, are making these\nsolutions increasingly accessible and scalable.\n\nAs technology continues to evolve, the future of industrial training with\nAR/VR looks promising. Businesses that embrace these innovations will gain a\ncompetitive edge by enhancing workforce efficiency, reducing training-related\ncosts, and fostering a safer working environment.\n\n* * *\n\n**AR and VR technologies are revolutionizing industrial training by providing\nimmersive, safe, and cost-effective learning experiences. As businesses strive\nto upskill their workforce and stay competitive, embracing AR/VR-based\ntraining solutions can lead to improved efficiency, reduced risks, and higher\nemployee engagement.**\n\n* * *\n\nAt Simelabs, we specialize in developing AR/VR training solutions tailored to\nyour industry's needs.

Each module supports a specific task or business goal and\ncommunicates with other sets of services via a simple, well-defined interface,\nsuch as an application programming interface (API).\n\nMartin Fowler, a software developer, and the author is credited with\npopularising the concept of breaking down service-oriented architecture (SOA)\nservices into microservices.\n\n**History**\n\nThe history and origins of microservices can be traced back to a continuous\neffort to improve communication between platforms, simplify systems, and make\nthem more user-friendly. It is a software development technique that groups\ntogether loosely coupled services to organise an application. However, it can\nbe any type of small service that interacts with other services to run a\nsoftware application. Microservices architecture makes use of fine-grained\nservices and lightweight protocols.\n\nDuring a 2005 presentation on cloud computing, Dr. Peter Rodgers coined the\nterm \"Micro-Web-Services.\" Rodgers went against the grain and advocated for\nsoftware components that support micro-web services. He established a\nfunctional model of microservices in his presentation, which eventually became\na reality. \"Any service, at any granularity, can be exposed,\" he said,\nexplaining how complex service assemblies work behind simple URI interfaces.\nHe went on to say that a well-organized micro-web-services platform \"applies\nthe underlying architectural principles of the Web and REST services together\nwith Unix-like scheduling and pipelines to provide radical flexibility and\nimproved simplicity in service-oriented architectures\".\n\n### **Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture**\n\nAll processes in monolithic architectures are tightly coupled and run as a\nsingle service. This means that if the demand for one of the application's\nprocesses increases, the entire architecture must be scaled. Adding or\nimproving features to a monolithic application becomes more difficult as the\ncode base grows. This complexity restricts experimentation and makes\nimplementing new ideas difficult. Because there are so many dependent and\ntightly coupled processes in monolithic architectures, a single process\nfailure has a greater impact. An application built with a microservices\narchitecture is made up of independent components that run each application\nprocess as a service. These services communicate using lightweight APIs and a\nwell-defined interface. Services are designed to support business\ncapabilities, and each one serves a single purpose. Because each service is\nrun independently, it can be updated, deployed, and scaled to meet the demand\nfor specific application functions.\n\n### **Microservices architecture**\n\nWe must first decide how we want to structure our microservices before we can\ncreate a sample microservices architecture. We could, for example, divide them\nvertically into levels:\n\n  * Central services - Business data persistence and application of business rules and other logic are handled by central services.\n  * Composite services\u2014Combining a number of central services to accomplish a common goal or aggregating data from multiple central services.\n  * API services \u2014 Allow third parties to develop creative applications that use the underlying functionality in the system landscape by opening up functionality to the outside world.\n\nIn this case, we'd use a horizontal structure based on domains to represent\nbusiness functionalities.\n\nBefore scaling microservices, it's critical to define a target architecture;\notherwise, the IT landscape could devolve into chaos and exhibit worse\nproperties than existing monolithic applications.\n\nThe benefits of microservices architecture include:\n\n  * Microservices have grown in popularity, and many technologies and cloud vendors now support them. Because of their easy availability, many businesses are adopting microservices due to their combination of efficiency and support.\n  * Microservices are language agnostic, meaning they can work with almost any technology with a few minor tweaks.\n  * DevOps: Microservice architecture is built to support DevOps philosophies. DevOps, on the other hand, aids in the development of microservices-based applications.\n  * Resource Availability: The focus of previous service architecture designs was on shared resources. The use of shared resources made the work unnecessarily difficult. Microservices' architectural design allows each service to be encapsulated. This allows developers to make changes to microservices without affecting other services.\n\n**Main reasons for adopting microservices as part of your future stack:**\n\n**1\\. Flexibility:** Microservices allow different services to use the best\ntechnology for their needs. Each team implementing a specific service can\nchoose their preferred programming language and framework because they are\nworking independently. Despite this, the services can communicate easily\nwithin the app. Furthermore, its independence allows for the continued\noperation of single services without causing harm to others.\n\n**2\\. Reusability:** After a microservice architecture is designed and\nimplemented, the schematic diagram can be reused and improved for future\nprojects and services. That means that much of the basic architecture can be\npreserved and reused, even if the programming language, development tools, and\nso on are different.\n\n**3\\. Lowers Risk:** Because each service in the framework is a separate\nentity, it can operate on its own. As a result, if one component fails, the\nentire application continues to run without interruption. This method only\nrequires the repair or rebuilding of one piece. The chances of the business\napps collapsing are reduced as a result.\n\nThey also allow businesses to better manage their resources, which reduces\ncosts. Separate teams can use them to work on various services, allowing them\nto operate more quickly. As a result, development time is reduced, and costly\nmachinery is avoided as a result of splitting services. The increased\nefficiency of microservices lowers infrastructure costs while also lowering IT\ncosts.\n\n**5\\. Agility:** Each service in a microservice architecture performs only one\nfunction. Because of the lightweight codebase, each service can be released,\nscaled, and tested independently. Because of this benefit, Amazon switched\nfrom a monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture.\n\n**6\\. Continuous delivery:** Microservices use a continuous delivery paradigm\nto manage the entire lifecycle of an application. Testing becomes simple and\nquick when development and testing teams work together on a single service.\nThis strategy allows businesses to build and test code on a continuous basis\nwhile also allowing them to use code from existing libraries.\n\nMicroservices, like any other software paradigm, is not a magic solution. It\nshould be one of the many tools in the toolbox of the product/solution\narchitect. Other approaches can also realise the underlying principles of\n\"loose coupling and high cohesion.\" Remember that when you use microservices,\nyou're agreeing to create a distributed system, and while many excellent open-\nsource frameworks have made this once-difficult model more accessible and\naffordable, there are still premiums and overheads to consider.\n\n**Conclusion  **\n\n  * Begin by developing a solid business case. Examining whether your application can be expressed as a set of business capabilities with clear boundaries is an important part of this activity.\n  * Clearly map your application requirements to microservices characteristics. If you only need scale-out, for example, containerization may be a better option than microservices. If the majority of your requirements correspond to microservices characteristics, you've found a good match.\n  * Finer details, such as how \"micro\" the services must be or whether you prefer a single data store (but databases/tables must not overlap), can be addressed later.\n  * When containers and container orchestrators are part of the deployment architecture, pay special attention to logging and performance metrics.\n  * Take a phased approach, reviewing and evaluating each phase as you go.\n  * There is no one-size-fits-all approach to getting started with microservices. Our customers have used microservices for both greenfield and brownfield projects, according to our experience. Some people have only used microservices chassis without containers, while others have used microservices and containers.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/tag/machine-learning/", "title": "Machine Learning Archives - Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Machine Learning\n\n##  How is Intelligent Connectivity Shaping the Future of Digital\nTransformation?\n\nMarch 3, 2025 9:10 am\n\nTechnology is no longer working in silos; instead, it is converging to create\na more\n\n##  AI Ops : The IT Glow-Up You Didn't Know You Needed\n\nSeptember 9, 2024 12:01 pm\n\nAs businesses embrace digital transformation, IT environments have become more\nintricate and harder to manage.\n\n##  What's the future look like for healthcare with remote patient\nmonitoring..?\n\nAugust 16, 2024 8:25 am\n\nThe landscape of healthcare is undergoing a significant transformation, driven\nby innovative approaches like the\n\n##  Leveling Up Manufacturing : How AI Predicts Quality, Cuts Waste, and\nBoosts Efficiency\n\nJuly 25, 2024 7:15 am\n\nIn the fast-changing world of manufacturing, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is\nproving to be a game-changer.\n\n##  Intelligent Automation for NAV Price Publishing\n\nMay 18, 2023 8:32 am\n\nReduce human intervention in handling fund data emails An AI-ML-powered web\napplication that efficiently reads\n\n##  Exploring artificial intelligence and machine learning in the renewable\nenergy sector.\n\nApril 13, 2022 5:49 am\n\nTechnology and its footprints have been on the rise now more than ever.

Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Don't Waste Your Money in the Cloud!\n\n## **Here 's How to Control Costs..**\n\nIn today's fast-paced business world, cloud computing has emerged as a\npowerful tool for scaling operations and driving innovation. However, without\nproper management, cloud costs can quickly spiral out of control, leading to\nsignificant financial waste. Businesses can lose their cloud spend on unused\nor underutilized resources if they aren't vigilant. To help you make the most\nof your cloud investment and avoid unnecessary expenses, we've outlined some\nkey strategies for effective cloud cost management.  \n\n## **Understanding the Cloud Waste Problem**\n\n**Cloud waste** refers to the inefficient use of cloud resources that results\nin unnecessary expenses. When businesses migrate to the cloud, they often\nprovision more resources than they need, leading to over-spending. Common\ncauses of cloud waste include:\n\n  1. **Unused Resources:** Services or instances that are left running but are not being used.\n  2. **Over-Provisioned Services:** Resources that are larger or more powerful than necessary for the actual workload.\n  3. **Inefficient Rightsizing:** Under-provisioning can lead to performance issues and increased costs due to scaling up instances frequently Where over-provisioning results in paying for unused capacity**.**\n  4. **Underutilized data transfer:** Inefficient data transfer practices between regions or within the cloud can incur unnecessary costs.\n  5. **Lack of cost optimization strategies** : Absence of proactive cost-saving measures like reserved instances &  savings plans..\n  6. **Security overprovisioning** : Excessive security measures, such as over-provisioned security groups or unnecessary data encryption, can lead to increased costs.\n\n## **Collaborate for Effective Cloud Cost Management**\n\nThe successful management of cloud costs necessitates a strong partnership\nbetween finance and IT departments. Finance brings a critical perspective on\nbudgetary constraints and the overall financial implications of cloud\nspending. They can establish clear cost limits and monitor expenditure\nclosely, ensuring that cloud investments align with organizational goals. On\nthe other hand, IT teams possess in-depth knowledge of cloud resource\nmanagement and deployment. Understanding the cost implications of their\ndecisions is paramount. By collaborating, these two departments can establish\nshared objectives and strategies for optimizing cloud resource utilization.\n\nRegular communication is essential for effective collaboration. Jointly\nsetting budgets, tracking expenses, and identifying cost-saving opportunities\nrequire open dialogue and information sharing. By working together, finance\nand IT can determine how cloud costs should be allocated across different\ndepartments or projects, ensuring fair chargeback and accountability.\nFurthermore, a collaborative approach helps mitigate potential cost risks. By\ncombining financial expertise with IT insights, organizations can make data-\ndriven decisions to optimize cloud spending. This includes identifying\nopportunities for rightsizing resources, leveraging reserved instances, and\nimplementing other cost-saving measures.\n\nCultivating a culture of cost awareness throughout the organization is\ncrucial. By fostering a shared commitment to efficiency, both finance and IT\ncan work together to continuously review cloud spending, identify areas for\nimprovement, and implement process changes to reduce costs. This ongoing\ncollaboration ensures that cloud resources are utilized optimally, delivering\nmaximum value while minimizing expenses. Ultimately, the synergy between\nfinance and IT is essential for achieving effective cloud cost management. By\naligning their efforts and leveraging their respective strengths,\norganizations can optimize cloud investments, reduce costs, and drive business\ngrowth.\n\n**Gaining Visibility into Cloud Spend**\n\n**Visibility into cloud spending** involves tracking and analyzing where your\nmoney is going. Key practices include:\n\n  * **Tagging Resources:** Applying labels (or tags) to cloud resources helps you track costs by different categories such as department, project, or business unit. This granularity provides insights into which areas are consuming the most resources and incurring the highest costs.\n\n  * **Setting Budgets:** Establishing budgets for different teams or projects helps prevent unexpected expenses. Cloud providers often offer budget management tools and alerts to notify you when spending approaches or exceeds set limits.\n\n  * **Monitoring Tools:** Utilize dashboards and reports provided by cloud service providers to monitor usage patterns and spending trends. These tools help you stay informed and make data-driven decisions.\n\n**Continuously Optimize Cloud Usage**\n\n**Cloud optimization** is an ongoing process that involves adjusting resources\nto better fit your needs. Key aspects include:\n\n  * **Identifying Underutilized Resources:** Regularly review your resources to find those that are not being used effectively. For instance, if a virtual machine (VM) is running at a fraction of its capacity, it\u2019s an indication that it might be oversized.\n\n  * **Rightsizing Resources:** Adjust the size of your resources based on actual usage. For example, if you\u2019re using a high-performance VM but only need a smaller one, resizing it can lead to significant cost savings.\n\n  * **Review and Adjust:** Periodically review your cloud usage and costs to ensure that your resources remain aligned with your current needs and budget.\n\n**Developer 's Role in Cost Optimization**\n\nApp designers and developers are crucial in controlling cloud expenses. By\nincorporating cost awareness into the development process, substantial savings\ncan be realized. This includes making well-informed choices regarding code\nrefinement, resource allocation, and system design.\n\nStreamlined code can significantly affect both performance and costs.\nEnhancing code for efficiency and speed reduces processing time and resource\nusage. Furthermore, judiciously choosing the right resources based on workload\nneeds avoids overprovisioning. Adopting serverless or container-based\narchitectures can also optimize expenses by matching resource utilization with\nactual demand, eliminating the necessity for idle servers.\n\n**Leverage Automation for Cost Efficiency**\n\n**Automation** can greatly enhance cloud cost management by reducing manual\neffort and minimizing errors. Key automation strategies include:\n\n  * **Auto-Scaling:** Set up auto-scaling policies that automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand. This helps in efficiently managing resources during peak and off-peak times.\n\n  * **Scheduled Resource Management:** Automate tasks such as turning off resources during non-business hours to avoid paying for unused capacity.\n\n  * **Automated Alerts and Actions:** Use automated alerts to notify you of unexpected cost increases or resource usage. Automated actions can then be triggered to address these issues promptly.\n\n## **Partnering with Simelabs for Expert Cloud Solutions**\n\nTo further enhance your cloud cost management, we are excited to announce that\nSimelabs is now an Amazon partner.

So apparently,\nminting an NFT is the process of executing that transaction on the blockchain.\n\n## Moralis\n\nThere can be many ways one can request the blockchain. But Moralis provides\nthe easiest and simplest way of connecting to cross-chains. Moralis is a\nsoftware or a middleware which helps us to build cross-chain dapps quickly.\nUsing moralis, we can build and deploy our dapps on any blockchain like\nEthereum, Polygon, Solana, BSC, and Avalanche. As a developer, we don\u2019t need\nto customize our dapp for every blockchain as moralis will do the needful.\nWith the use of Moralis, the entire process of creating an NFT can be made as\nsimple as possible.\n\n**_Moralis account and server setup_**\n\n  1. Create a free Moralis account : https://admin.moralis.io/login\n\nMoralis Sign Up or Sign In\n\n2\\. Create a new server depends on the requirement of dealing with a testnet\nor a mainnet. First, explore the testnet before getting into the mainnet.\n\nMoralis Server\n\n3\\. Create a Moralis instance by giving a name to your testnet server and\nchoosing a region as well as the blockchains to work with.\n\nMoralis Instance\n\n4\\. Copy the Server URL, Application ID and Master Key as we need these server\ndetails to connect with Moralis.\n\nMoralis Server Details\n\n _Now, our Moralis server is up, what next? \u2014 We need to add Polygon Mumbai\ntestnet to your metamask account._\n\nMoralis provides speedy nodes to quickly connect to the corresponding\nblockchains.\n\nMoralis Speedy Nodes Endpoints\n\nUse the Polygon Mumbai speedy node endpoint as the RPC URL. Chain ID for\npolygon Mumbai testnet is 80001. You can verify the chain ID in\nhttps://chainlist.org/. MATIC is the token handled in polygon blockchain.\n\nMumbai Testnet in Metamask\n\n## Web3js\n\nWeb3js is a library that allows us to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nInstall web3 as below:\n\n    \n    \n    npm install web3\n\n _How to Mint an NFT in a decentralized manner? \u2014 using IPFS decentralized\nstorage solution. Kudos to Moralis as it provides native support for IPFS so\nthat we don\u2019t need to handle IPFS separately._\n\n## IPFS\n\nIPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a peer-to-peer protocol like torrent.  \nIt decentralizes the entire file hosting process. When we upload a file to\nIPFS, it gets distributed across every node which becomes a server so that no\none can take down a file. We are hosting our NFT metadata on IPFS.\n\n_Now lets jump into the process of minting an NFT._\n\n## Step 1: Install Moralis Package in your nodejs project\n\n    \n    \n    npm install moralis/node\n\n## Step 2: Initialize your Moralis server\n\n    \n    \n    require(\"dotenv\").config();  \n    const express = require(\"express\");  \n    const Moralis = require(\u201cmoralis/node\u201d);  \n    const app = express();const {  PORT,  MORALIS_SERVER_URL,  MORALIS_APP_ID,  MORALIS_MASTER_KEY,} = process.env;app.listen(port, async () => {   await Moralis.start({      serverUrl: MORALIS_SERVER_URL,      appId: MORALIS_APP_ID,      masterKey: MORALIS_MASTER_KEY,   });});\n\n## Step 3: Create .env file\n\nYour .env file should look like below:\n\n    \n    \n    MORALIS_SERVER_URL = \"moralis server URL\"MORALIS_APP_ID = \"moralis app Id\"MORALIS_MASTER_KEY = \"moralis master key\"PORT = \"port\"PRIVATE_KEY = \"metamask private key\"PUBLIC_KEY = \"your metamask wallet address\"CONTRACT_ADDRESS = \"deployed contract address\"POLYGON_MUMBAI_RPC_PROVIDER = \"moralis Mumbai Speedy Node RPC URL\"\n\n## Step 2: Create your nft.js file\n\nCopy the following content to the file.\n\n    \n    \n    require(\"dotenv\").config();const Web3 = require(\"web3\");const request = require(\"request-promise\");const fs = require(\"fs\");const contract = require(\"../artifacts/contracts/ArGram.sol/ArGram.json\");const provider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(POLYGON_MUMBAI_RPC_PROVIDER);const web3 = new Web3(provider);web3.eth.accounts.wallet.add(PRIVATE_KEY);const nftContract = new web3.eth.Contract(contract.abi, CONTRACT_ADDRESS);fs.readFile(req.file.path, async (err, buffer) => {    const image = buffer.toString(\"base64\");  \n        const contentType = req.file.mimetype;    //Upload image file to IPFS  \n        const file = new Moralis.File(\"file\", image, contentType);  \n        await file.saveIPFS({ useMasterKey: true });  \n        const fileIPFS = file.ipfs();    //Create JSON metadata  \n        const metadata = {  \n           name: \"MyNFT\",  \n           description: \"MyNFT Description\",  \n           image: fileIPFS,  \n        };    //Upload JSON metadata to IPFS  \n        const toBtoa = Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(metadata)).toString(\"base64\");  \n        const json = new Moralis.File(`MyNFT-meta.json`, { base64: toBtoa });  \n        await json.saveIPFS({ useMasterKey: true });  \n        const tokenURI = json.ipfs();    //Mint NFT  \n        const nonce = await web3.eth.getTransactionCount(PUBLIC_KEY, \u201clatest\u201d);  \n        const transaction = {  \n            from: PUBLIC_KEY,  \n            to: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,  \n            nonce: nonce,  \n            gas: 500000,  \n            data: nftContract.methods  \n                         .mintNFT(PUBLIC_KEY, tokenURI)  \n                         .encodeABI(),  \n        };  \n        const signPromise = await web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(  \n            transaction,  \n            PRIVATE_KEY  \n        );  \n        const signedTransaction = await web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(  \n            signPromise[\u201crawTransaction\u201d]  \n        );  \n        const hash = signedTransaction[\u201ctransactionHash\u201d];  \n        console.log('The transaction hash is:', hash);  \n    }\n\nYou will get a transaction hash like:\n0x9732ca53cfb6b8e29e13873b51407f431bc798cbe3abe82ea110c0e5924506c8\n\nYou can search for this transaction on mumbai polygonscan.\n\nTransaction on Mumbai Polygonscan\n\nGreat!

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Discover how AI is transforming data quality management by automating cleansing, detecting anomalies, and ensuring compliance. Learn how organizations can leverage AI-driven frameworks to maintain superior data integrity and drive business success.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Harnessing AI for Superior Data Integrity and Management\n\nIn a world where data is king, having top-tier, error-free info isn\u2019t just\nnice\u2014it\u2019s a game-changer. Companies need solid, reliable data to make smart\nmoves, keep things running smoothly, and stay out of trouble. But let\u2019s be\nreal, managing data at scale is tough. That\u2019s where AI swoops in, automating\nthe boring stuff, spotting mistakes, and keeping data fresh and flawless 24/7.\n\n### **Transforming Data Quality Management with AI**\n\nAI-powered solutions offer a game-changing approach to data quality by\nautomating cleansing and standardization. AI can detect and correct errors,\ninconsistencies, and formatting issues, ensuring that data adheres to\npredefined standards. Through real-time monitoring, AI continuously scans\ndatasets to identify anomalies, missing values, and duplicates, preventing\nissues before they impact business operations. Machine learning algorithms\nanalyze patterns and trends, uncovering hidden correlations in data that help\norganizations understand quality trends and areas for improvement. Predictive\nanalytics proactively detect potential data quality issues, enabling\nbusinesses to take corrective actions before they escalate. AI-powered tools\nalso streamline master data management by automating entity resolution,\ndeduplication, and harmonization across multiple sources. Additionally, AI\nensures compliance by enforcing data governance policies and monitoring\nregulatory adherence in real time.\n\n### **Building an Effective AI-Powered Data Quality Framework**\n\nTo maximize the benefits of AI in data quality management, organizations must\nestablish a well-structured framework. A successful AI-driven data quality\ninitiative starts with a well-defined strategy that aligns with business\nobjectives. Organizations must identify their critical data assets, define\nquality benchmarks, and prioritize areas where AI can add the most value.\nEstablishing clear data quality standards and key performance indicators\nensures that AI models operate within defined parameters, covering aspects\nsuch as accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, and reliability.\n\nLeveraging advanced AI-driven data quality platforms and machine learning\nmodels enhances automation and accuracy. Key technologies include natural\nlanguage processing for unstructured data processing, machine learning\nalgorithms for anomaly detection, robotic process automation for data\nvalidation and correction, and knowledge graphs for semantic data enrichment.\nImplementing AI-powered data quality solutions requires a skilled team with\nexpertise in data science, AI, data engineering, and governance. Collaboration\nbetween IT, business users, and data governance teams is crucial for\nsuccessful deployment.\n\nBuilding a data-driven culture ensures that data quality remains a shared\nresponsibility across the organization. Promoting awareness, accountability,\nand continuous improvement helps sustain high-quality data practices. AI\nmodels must evolve with changing business needs and data landscapes.\nOrganizations should invest in model retraining, feedback loops, and regular\naudits to ensure AI-driven data quality processes remain effective.\n\n### **Overcoming Challenges in AI-Driven Data Quality**\n\nDespite its advantages, AI-powered data quality management comes with\nchallenges. AI models rely on high-quality training data, and poor training\ndatasets can lead to inaccurate predictions and unreliable insights. Model\nbias is another concern, as AI algorithms may inherit biases from historical\ndata, leading to skewed outcomes. Organizations must implement bias detection\nand mitigation strategies to ensure fairness and accuracy. Deploying AI\nsolutions across legacy systems and diverse data sources requires robust\nintegration capabilities, which can present technical complexities.\nAdditionally, the demand for AI and data science talent is high, and\norganizations must address skill gaps by upskilling employees and leveraging\nAI-powered no-code or low-code platforms.\n\n### **The Competitive Advantage of AI-Driven Data Quality**\n\nBy adopting AI-powered data quality solutions, organizations can enhance\ndecision-making with accurate and reliable data. Improved operational\nefficiency through automation leads to cost savings and streamlined workflows.\nAI-driven data quality solutions also help reduce compliance risks and\nregulatory penalties by enforcing strict governance policies. High-quality\ndata enables businesses to unlock new opportunities and generate insights that\ndrive growth. Ultimately, organizations that implement AI in data quality\nmanagement gain a competitive edge in the data-driven economy.\n\nAI is revolutionizing data quality management, making it more efficient,\nproactive, and scalable. By implementing a structured framework, addressing\nchallenges, and fostering a data-driven culture, organizations can harness the\nfull potential of AI to ensure superior data quality and drive business\nsuccess.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How is Intelligent Connectivity Shaping the Future of Digital\nTransformation?\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/tag/simelabs/", "title": "Simelabs Archives - Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Simelabs\n\n##  Unveiling Amazon Q : The Future of Generative AI for Enterprises\n\nFebruary 24, 2025 8:44 am\n\nAs artificial intelligence continues to revolutionize industries, enterprises\nare seeking more sophisticated and tailored solutions\n\n##  RAG | Enhancing AI's ability to access and process information.\n\nSeptember 3, 2024 10:39 am\n\nIn today\u2019s rapidly advancing world of artificial intelligence (AI), the pace\nof innovation is both\n\n##  How\u2019s AR/VR about to change the game in marketing with epic immersive\nexperiences?\n\nSeptember 3, 2024 8:49 am\n\nIn today's super-connected world, brands are always on the hunt for the next\nbig thing\n\n##  Industry Cloud: Can Your Business Afford to Wait?\n\nAugust 23, 2024 8:43 am\n\nIn the rapidly evolving digital landscape, businesses are continuously seeking\ntailored solutions to meet the\n\n##  What's the future look like for healthcare with remote patient\nmonitoring..?\n\nAugust 16, 2024 8:25 am\n\nThe landscape of healthcare is undergoing a significant transformation, driven\nby innovative approaches like the\n\n##  IoT in Supply Chains: The Game-Changer Your Business Needs !!\n\nAugust 16, 2024 6:24 am\n\nReady to level up your supply chain?

Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# How Can Machine Learning Help You Spot Customer Churn Before It Happens ?\n\nIn the competitive landscape of modern business, understanding and addressing\ncustomer churn is crucial for maintaining profitability and growth. Customer\nchurn, the phenomenon where customers stop using a product or service, can\nsignificantly impact revenue and brand loyalty. By leveraging machine learning\n(ML), organizations can effectively predict and mitigate churn, allowing for a\nproactive approach to customer retention.\n\n### **Understanding Customer Churn**\n\nCustomer churn, also known as attrition, refers to the loss of clients or\ncustomers over a specified period. In various industries, especially those\nwith subscription-based models, churn can represent a significant loss of\npotential revenue. Churn is typically classified into two types:\n\n**Voluntary Churn** : Customers choose to leave for reasons such as\ndissatisfaction with the product or service, better offerings from\ncompetitors, or changes in personal circumstances.\n\n**Involuntary Churn** : Customers leave due to circumstances outside their\ncontrol, such as changes in payment methods, credit card expirations, or\nchanges in company policies.\n\nUnderstanding the reasons behind churn is essential for developing effective\nretention strategies. For example, a customer may churn due to poor customer\nservice experiences or product dissatisfaction. Identifying these factors can\nhelp organizations address issues before customers decide to leave.\n\n### **The Role of Machine Learning in Churn Prediction**\n\nMachine learning provides powerful tools for analyzing vast datasets,\nuncovering hidden patterns, and predicting customer behavior. By employing ML\nalgorithms, businesses can transform their approach to churn management from\nreactive to proactive.\n\n  1. **Predictive Analytics** : ML models can analyze historical customer data to predict future behavior, including churn likelihood. This predictive capability enables businesses to identify high-risk customers and take timely action.  \n\n  2. **Segmentation** : Machine learning allows organizations to segment customers based on behavior, preferences, and churn risk. This segmentation enables targeted marketing and personalized communication strategies.  \n\n  3. **Real-Time Insights** : ML models can process data in real-time, providing immediate insights into customer behaviour. This allows businesses to adapt their strategies swiftly, enhancing customer engagement.\n\n## **Key Steps in Developing a Customer Churn Prediction Model**\n\nDeveloping a churn prediction model involves several key steps, each crucial\nfor building an effective system.\n\n#### **1\\. Data Collection**\n\nThe first step in building any machine learning model is gathering relevant\ndata. For churn prediction, data typically includes customer demographics,\ntransactional history, product usage, customer service interactions, and more.\nIt\u2019s important to have comprehensive data to train a model that can generalize\nwell to new, unseen cases.\n\n#### **2\\. Data Pre-processing**\n\nRaw data is rarely ready for machine learning models right away. Data pre\nprocessing involves cleaning, transforming, and structuring the data to make\nit usable. This includes handling missing data, encoding categorical\nvariables, normalizing numerical features, and splitting data into training\nand testing sets.\n\n#### **3\\. Feature Engineering**\n\nFeature engineering is the process of selecting or creating features that will\nbe used by the model. Common features for churn prediction might include the\nfrequency of customer interactions, average purchase size, time since the last\npurchase, and customer sentiment based on reviews or surveys.\n\n#### **4\\. Choosing the Right Model**\n\nThere are several machine learning algorithms that can be used for churn\nprediction, including:\n\n  * Logistic Regression: A simple and interpretable model suitable for binary classification (churn vs. no churn).\n  * Decision Trees and Random Forests: These models are more powerful for complex, non-linear data.\n  * Support Vector Machines (SVM): Effective for high-dimensional datasets, though they can be computationally intensive.\n  * Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): This family of algorithms, including XGBoost and LightGBM, often delivers the best predictive performance.\n  * Neural Networks: For larger datasets, neural networks can model more complex relationships in the data, although they require more resources and tuning.\n\n#### **5\\. Model Training & Evaluation**\n\nOnce the model is selected, it is trained using the training dataset. After\ntraining, it is essential to evaluate the model's performance on the testing\nset. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are useful in\nassessing the model\u2019s performance, but in churn prediction, precision and\nrecall are particularly important. A high recall ensures that most customers\nat risk of churning are identified, while precision minimizes false positives.\n\n#### **6\\. Hyperparameter Tuning**\n\nHyperparameter tuning involves adjusting the settings of the machine learning\nalgorithm to improve its performance. Techniques like grid search or random\nsearch can help optimize these parameters and boost model accuracy.\n\n#### **7\\. Deployment & Monitoring**\n\nOnce the model performs well, it can be deployed into production where it can\nbegin predicting churn in real-time. However, machine learning models are not\nstatic; they need to be continuously monitored and updated with new data to\nmaintain accuracy and relevance over time.\n\n* * *\n\n# **Case Study** | **Predicting Customer Churn for a Pharmaceutical Company**\n\nTo illustrate the effectiveness of churn prediction models, let\u2019s look at one\nof our case studies involving a multinational biopharmaceutical company\nfocusing on therapeutic areas like cardiovascular disease, oncology, and\ninflammation.**** The client\u2019s drug, Otezla (apremilast), is a prescription\nmedicine used to treat adult patients with plaque psoriasis when phototherapy\nor systemic therapy is appropriate. The objective was to identify leading\nindicators causing customer sales decline for Otezla and predict if a patient\nwould drop out of the treatment.\n\n### **Goals & Objectives**\n\n  1. Determine the factors leading to sales decline for Otezla.\n  2. Forecast potential dropouts among Otezla patients to implement timely interventions.\n\n### **Overview of the Solution**\n\nThe customer faced the challenge of improving sales by identifying factors\nthat trigger healthcare professionals (HCPs) to stop prescribing Otezla.\nAdditionally, understanding probable patient dropouts and the factors leading\nto them was critical.\n\nTo address these issues, an omni-channel platform was created to analyse\nmarketing insights, managing 1TB of structured and semi-structured data daily.\n\n  * **Customer Model** : A classification model was developed to predict potential dropouts among HCPs. The model used engineered features to indicate a drop in sales or an increase in sales for competitor products.  \n\n  * **Patient Model** : Patients were clustered as a pre processing step, followed by the application of relevant ML models on each cluster.\n\nThe solution included a comprehensive ML training and prediction pipeline,\nincorporating model drift analysis for deployment and re-training.\n\n### **Business Outcomes**\n\nThe implementation of the churn prediction model led to:\n\n  * **Actionable Insights** : The model identified root causes of patient dropouts, allowing for targeted retention strategies.\n  * **Enhanced Customer Engagement** : Amgen representatives could engage more effectively with HCPs by understanding their specific concerns and needs.\n  * **Improved Marketing Strategies** : The organization developed tailored marketing campaigns based on predictive insights, which helped mitigate churn and foster loyalty.\n\n* * *\n\nCustomer churn prediction models powered by machine learning give businesses a\ncompetitive edge in retaining valuable customers. By leveraging historical\ndata, businesses can predict future behaviour, allowing them to take proactive\nmeasures to reduce churn. As a result, customer retention improves, and\nbusinesses can focus on nurturing long\n\n**Are you ready to reduce customer churn and enhance your business\u2019s growth\npotential?

Environmental risks and opportunities abound in today's world,\nalong with the options for reconciling environmental concerns with lending and\nfinancing arrangements.\n\nPreviously, traditional banks did not practice \"green\" banking up until a few\nyears ago. Apart from that they never sought active investment opportunities\nin environmentally friendly sectors or businesses. This gave rise to green\nfinance and green financial products and services, not just among smaller\nalternative and cooperative banks, but also among diversified financial\nservice providers, asset management firms, and insurance firms. Although the\nstated motivations for increasing environmental products may differ (for\nexample, to improve long-term growth prospects or the sustainability\nprinciples on which a company is founded), the growth, variation, and\ninnovation behind such developments indicate that we are in the midst of a\npromising drive toward \"green\" financial product development into mainstream\nbanking. Banks' strategies and actions are already shifting towards\nsustainability. A growing number of financial institutions are directing their\nresources and lending power toward preventing environmental degradation as\nwell as promoting sustainable consumer behaviour and decision-making. Some of\nthe main factors currently driving this marriage between banking and\nsustainability are lender liability, borrowers' ability to meet financial\nobligations, ecological deficits, and business opportunities. Furthermore,\nthis relationship is being strengthened by a variety of developments, both\ninternal and external to financial institutions' operations. The wide range of\ninternal opportunities to address sustainability in a bank's operations, from\ncorporate policy to energy reduction measures, demonstrates that addressing\nenvironmental issues can be a logical extension of the sector's general\nbusiness. Organizational policy, practice, and services; supply chain choices\nand demands; business development; reporting; public policy outreach;\nstakeholder engagement; research collaboration with other governmental and\nnon-governmental entities; and institutional donations or other philanthropic\nefforts are all possible areas and practices where sustainability issues may\narise. According to a 1997 study, a number of European UNEP-FI banks had set\nup environmental departments and began designing environmentally friendly\nproducts as well as providing environmental risk assessment services. As\nenvironmental risks and opportunities become more established elements in\ninternal banking policies and practices, these types of sustainability\ninitiatives are likely to grow.\n\nFinTechs have always been defined by their ability to both innovate and\ncontribute to long-term sustainability. FinTechs' role in assisting policy\nformulations aimed at transitioning to a low-carbon world is well understood\nby policymakers and regulators.\n\nFinance's role in any economy positions it well to lead the transition to a\nlow-carbon, more sustainable world. Furthermore, following the release of the\nlatest IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report, dubbed \"a code\nred for humanity,\" it has become even more critical to ensure the best\npossible allocation of capital (estimated at $6-$7 trillion per year) to this\ntransition.\n\nThe recent United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow not only\ndemonstrated progress on the historic Paris Agreement of 2015 but also\nhighlighted the challenges ahead on the long road to achieving the net-zero\nemissions goal by 2050. Every country, particularly the larger ones, must make\na significant investment.\n\nFor those looking to build their own platform, the following framework \u2014 which\nincludes structures and processes to ensure the reliability and consistency of\ndata analysis and decision-making \u2014 can be useful. The following five pillars\nsupport this framework:\n\n  1. The current state of ESG data is being examined. Determine what data is currently available and whether there are any data gaps that are relevant to ESG standards. Determine a method for gathering the remaining data needed to get a full picture of each company in a firm's portfolio.\n  2. Creating an easily accessible data center. A data hub gathers information from a variety of sources so that it can be accessed, edited, and analysed by everyone in the organisation. The data portfolio, analysis, and repository of an investment firm are kept in a data hub. Data hubs that are hosted in the cloud offer more flexibility and convenience.\n  3. Adding an extra layer of intelligence Using artificial intelligence and data analysis tools, investment firms will be able to better manage and extract insights from their ESG data. Specific lines of business can create individual data models to enable more tailored decision-making.\n  4. Developing a reporting capability for environmental, social, and governance (ESG). Customers demand complete transparency in order to ensure that ESG standards are adhered to. You must develop reporting, disclosure, and governance processes to achieve that level of trust, compliance, and transparency.\n  5. On the front end, data visualisation tools are used. Data visualisation tools such as charts, maps, and graphs allow us to quickly ingest large amounts of data and understand trends, patterns, and relationships. This is useful for managers who need to quickly assess the ESG status of companies in their portfolio.\n\nFirms can set themselves apart by conducting research, offering advice, and\ntracking the ESG performance of their client's portfolios through smarter,\nmore informed, data-driven decision-making.\n\nFirms that use the right business architecture and fintech tools to integrate\nESG into their financial advice management are more likely to earn their\nclients' trust and convert that trust into long-term relationships.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "There is a new-found understanding that applying digital technology for transformation of the business processes is a crucial element for success.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# The Handbook for Digital Transformation Success\n\nSuhail Senior Engineer\n\nThere is a new-found understanding that applying digital technology to\nbusiness processes is a crucial element for success. It is a doctrine that is\nswiping across every industry. Top companies know that for them to grow, be\nsuccessful and competitive, they have to apply the appropriate digital tools\nand thus adopt digital transformation.\n\nLikewise, they must go beyond the discarding of old systems and embrace\ndigital technology. To achieve digital transformation success, they must\nembrace new technologies both culturally and operationally.\n\nCurrently, most companies are kicking off their various digital projects.\nHowever, the goal is to implement digital solutions across their enterprise to\nmeet the demands of their information customers. As a result, a company\u2019s\ndigital transformation success will depend on the following\n\n  * Their ability to collect, compile and analyse huge amounts of data.\n  * How quickly they can adapt their business processes to the new digital solutions.\n  * Willingness to scale their IT infrastructure.\n  * Adopt a workplace culture that embraces digital transformation.\n\nAccording to the International Data Corps, by 2020, 60% of companies will\nembrace digital adoptions extensively. Therefore, it is apparent that to\nmaintain a competitive edge in any industry, a company has to have a\nsuccessful digital makeover.\n\n## **The Evolution to an Information-centric Business**\n\nIn today\u2019s world, business lines, operations and marketing all contribute to\nthe decision-making process of digital adoption. Previously, such decisions\nwere left to the CIOs and IT department heads. Stakeholders are aware that the\neffective use of data is crucial to successful business outcomes.\n\nIt is evident that companies that are information-centric will most likely\nmake better business decisions. They can employ analytic and predictive\ntechnologies to better address both potential and imminent problems. In so\ndoing, they will improve the productivity and creativity of their employees.\nAlso, employees will be able to leverage on the various opportunities of using\ninnovative technologies\n\nFor example, manufacturers incorporate internet of things (IoT) and digital\nTwin technology in product production. It enables them to increase performance\ndata inputs and create intelligent products. In the airline sector, companies\nemploy digital tools to closely observe hardware and effectively schedule\nrepairs. Hence, increasing the quality of transportation.\n\n## Adopting New Values with Legacy Infrastructures\n\nThe first step to achieving digital fluency and skills is to effectively\nconnect the digital world to the traditional business. The adoption must never\nbe sudden, rather implementation should be incremental. Companies are tackling\nissues with big data by deploying infrastructures that will serve as private\ncloud storage. Also, they employ the services of various public clouds to\nexpand their capacity.\n\nIn a rapidly changing society, companies must be able to link their\ntechnologies and scale quickly. Therefore, to stay ahead, every company has to\ninvest in new digital technologies and thus move a step towards digital\ntransformation success.\n\n## Paving a Digital Path To the Future\n\nTechnological changes are causing revolutions, but they are also allowing\ncompanies to stay relevant in the digital era. Nevertheless, the success of\nthe company is solely dependent on their own efforts. In conclusion, the\ndigital transformation success hinges on a clear plan with incremental goals.\nIt is the best way to avoid overwhelming decision-makers with a lot of\noptions. It is not a bad idea for companies to employ experienced personnel\ngifted in current technological trends. Also, the person must be able to help\nguide the company\u2019s digital transformation process.\n\nNext  __\n\n### IPFS File Upload \u2014 using Moralis\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/tag/supply-chain-optimization/", "title": "supply chain optimization Archives - Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# supply chain optimization\n\n##  IoT in Supply Chains: The Game-Changer Your Business Needs !!\n\nAugust 16, 2024 6:24 am\n\nReady to level up your supply chain?

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Let\u2019s understand AI applications in energy sector and their pros and cons, through a modern approach.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Exploring artificial intelligence and machine learning in the renewable\nenergy sector.\n\nTechnology and its footprints have been on the rise now more than ever. When\nit comes to artificial intelligence and machine learning in the renewable\nenergy sector, more action is urgently needed to avoid catastrophic long-term\nclimate impacts, based on the new IPCC report. Because fossil fuels still\nprovide more than 80% of global energy, the energy sector must be at the\nforefront of this effort.\n\nFortunately, the energy system is already changing and renewable energy\ngeneration is rapidly increasing, thanks to falling costs and increased\ninvestor interest. The scale and cost of decarbonizing the global energy\nsystem, on the other hand, remain enormous, and time is running out.\n\nTo date, despite artificial intelligence is a modern approach, the majority of\nthe**** energy sector's transition efforts have been concentrated on hardware\nnew low-carbon infrastructure to replace legacy carbon-intensive systems.\nAnother crucial tool for the transition has received relatively little\nattention and investment in next-generation digital technologies, particularly\nartificial intelligence (AI). These powerful technologies can be adopted at\nlarger scales more quickly than new hardware solutions, and they could become\na key enabler for the energy transition.\n\nWhile it is difficult to predict when it is widely acknowledged that fossil\nfuels will not be sufficient to meet our energy needs in the future. Renewable\nenergy is emerging as the most reliable option for our future, but despite\nsignificant progress in some areas, there are still many obstacles to\novercome. Solar and wind power are two of the most popular renewable energy\nsources, but they are weather-dependent and unpredictable, and we still need\nto smooth the energy flow from generation to consumption.**** Storage\ntechnology is improving, but it is still a long way from where it needs to be.\nRenewable energy generation will occasionally fall short of demand, so it\ncannot be a reliable source of baseload for consumption. The baseload\ncontinues to shift to fossil fuel-based generation, defeating the original\ngoal of moving to renewables.\n\nGrid operators, developers, and consumers are harnessing artificial\nintelligence (AI) as we move into the Fourth Industrial Revolution,**** paving\nthe way for a smooth transition to greater use of renewables. The ability of\nAI to provide better prediction capabilities enables improved demand\nforecasting and asset management, while its automation capability drives\noperational excellence, resulting in competitive advantage and cost savings\nfor stakeholders. As an example, consider Australia.**** Solar energy is\nexpected to be present on 30% of the country's residential, commercial, and\nindustrial buildings by 2030, and 60% by 2050.\n\n**1**. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) is assisting energy companies**\nin**detecting faults before they result in energy failures.**\n\nFailure of equipment is a common and costly concern in the global energy\nsector, with potentially disastrous consequences. By analysing data from\nsensors used to monitor equipment and detect failures ahead of disasters, AI-\npowered tools can help companies create ideal maintenance schedules. In the\nend, these advancements save businesses millions of dollars while improving\nenergy production and consumption efficiency, and reliability.\n\nThrough image analysis, companies like ABB use AI to detect faults such as\ncracks in pipelines and machinery. The company cites a pilot project with one\nof the world's largest hydroelectric utilities as an example. Research\nsuggests that after implementing ABB's platform, the company saw a 10%\nreduction in routine maintenance and a 2% increase in output, resulting in\ncost savings of millions of dollars, according to the company.\n\n**2\\. The transition to low-carbon energy systems :**\n\nDistributed power generation, distributed storage, and advanced demand-\nresponse capabilities are all exploding, and they need to be orchestrated and\nintegrated through more networked, transactional power grids.\n\nThe energy system and energy-intensive industries face enormous strategic and\noperational challenges in navigating these trends. AI can help energy-system\nstakeholders identify patterns and insights in data, learn from experience and\nimprove system performance over time, and predict and model possible outcomes\nof complex, multivariate situations by creating an intelligent coordination\nlayer across the generation, transmission, and use of energy.\n\n**3.**  **AI Is Helping Consumers** **Choose Their Best-Fit Energy Providers**\n\nConsumers in deregulated energy markets, such as the United States, can choose\ntheir energy providers. Lumator, a tool developed by Carnegie Mellon\nUniversity, analyses customer preferences and consumption data and compares it\nto available energy provider offers, including limited-time promotional rates.\nLumator allows consumers to find energy companies that provide the best deal\non the energy sources they use the most. Lumator can switch energy plans\nautomatically as better deals become available over time as it \"learns\" more\nabout customers.\n\nIn addition to cost savings, tools like Lumator can help increase the use of\nrenewable energy by analysing consumer preferences for renewable energy\nsources and reporting demand to energy producers, who can adjust supply\naccordingly.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning in the renewable energy sector\nhave far more potential to speed up the global energy transition, but this\npotential will only be realized if AI innovation, adoption, and collaboration\nare increased across the industry. However, AI is not a panacea, and no\ntechnological advancement can replace aggressive political and corporate\ncommitments to reduce emissions. We can't afford to leave any tools in the\ntoolbox, given the urgency, scale, and complexity of the global energy\ntransition.

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "A detailed look into the impact of augmented reality and virtual reality on the retail industry. Click to learn more.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Augmented reality and B2B Retail industry\n\n### **How companies are revamping their sales in B2B retail using augmented\nreality?**\n\nA detailed look into the impact of augmented reality and virtual reality on\nthe retail sales sector.\n\nFor most of us, augmented reality, or AR, is a concept limited to the gaming\nindustry. With the famous game Pokemon Go, the term was largely thrust into\nthe mainstream in 2016. The mobile AR app had 45 million users at its peak,\nmaking it the fastest mobile game to gross $100 million (along with four other\nGuinness World Records). Its use of technology, however, has had the greatest\ncultural impact. While Pokemon Go made augmented reality a household term, its\ncapabilities go far beyond entertainment. When it comes to Augmented reality\nin retail structure, as a consumer you may not have set foot in a physical\nstore other than supermarkets, as many people do for months. Of course, this\ndoes not imply that no purchases have been made during this time. As a result\nof the pandemic, e-commerce has exploded, with shoppers turning to the\ninternet instead of going to stores. We can see that the use of augmented\nreality technology in retail has been able to provide a unique and immersive\nshopping experience, in addition to simply online shopping. While the use of\naugmented reality has grown in recent years, the pandemic's impact has created\na once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for AR retail to thrive.\n\nAR has been used for commercial purposes since 2008, when it was combined with\na printed magazine advertisement for the BMW mini, according to the Harvard\nBusiness Review. When the ad was held up to a computer camera, an on-screen\ncar appeared, which users could control by moving the ad. This may not seem\nsignificant now, given the prevalence of Instagram filters in most of our\ndaily lives, but it was groundbreaking at the time. Since then, augmented\nreality experiences have become a popular way to improve consumer decision-\nmaking and purchasing experiences, even in the B2B world.\n\n### **Virtual reality and the Retail industry****\n\nVirtual reality retail experiences are changing the way people purchase in\nstores. There is huge potential to grow into virtual settings, with the global\naugmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) market anticipated to reach 1.6\nbillion by 2021. Both shops and customers benefit from creating a virtual\nshopping experience. It has the potential to lower overall operating expenses\nand provide immersive experiences for customers to test out and modify before\npurchasing.\n\nA famous example would be the brand \u201cKellogg\u201d. When Kellogg intended to\nintroduce their new Pop-Tarts Bites product in 2019, they teamed up with\nAccenture and Qualcomm to develop a virtual reality (VR) solution to assist\nthem to figure out where to put it on the shelves. The IT companies\ncollaborated to develop a lifelike virtual supermarket, replete with aisles,\nshelves, and products, where focus group participants could \"shop\" using\nvirtual reality headsets and an innovative eye-tracking analytics system.\n\n Let\u2019s list 3 famous places where Augmented reality is paving its way with B2B\nretail market industry:\n\n  * IKEA\n\nCustomers can use apps like IKEA Place to see how different pieces of\nfurniture would look in their homes. Customers can use this augmented reality\nmobile app to \"put\" items of furniture in a room to gain a feel of their\ndimensions in relation to the area and surrounding goods, rather than\npurchasing improperly sized items and returning them when they do not fit in a\nroom. These apps were developed before the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing\nlockdowns, but they are ideal for this situation. Customers can buy furniture\nonline with greater confidence when they are unable to see it in person at a\nreal store. Furthermore, 'test, before you buy, helps to lower the number of\nreturns, which, regardless of lockup restrictions, can be an onerous process\nfor large or cumbersome furniture.\n\n  * YOUTUBE\n\nWith its new 'interactive commercials,' the large video-sharing site, which is\none of the top digital marketing trend predictions for 2021 (Think With\nGoogle), sees the potential in AR. Users can visually try on makeup while\nwatching video content like product evaluations on YouTube's AR Beauty Try-On.\nMAC is the first company to test this, with approximately 30% of customers\nusing the function.\n\n  * VOLKSWAGEN\n\nThe VW T-Cross, which premiered in grand style at the 2018 Sao Paulo Auto\nShow, was Volkswagen's largest launch in 2018. The fact that it wouldn't be\navailable in dealerships until April posed the biggest hurdle. As a result, a\nquick strategy was needed to keep expectations high during the five months of\nwaiting. With this in mind, Volkswagen developed Volkswagen AR, an augmented\nreality software that allows users to examine a 1:1 scale reproduction of the\ncar's interior and exterior elements in great detail. People were able to see\nnew models before they were released on the market, which helped them acquire\nsales.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/unveiling-amazon-q-the-future-of-generative-ai-for-enterprises/", "title": "Unveiling Amazon Q : The Future of Generative AI for Enterprises - Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Discover Amazon Q, AWS\u2019s generative AI-powered assistant designed to streamline enterprise operations with seamless integrations, contextual intelligence, and robust security.

Enter Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality\n(VR)\u2014tech that promises mind-blowing, immersive experiences to hook users and\nboost sales. But let's be real, despite all the hype, AR/VR hasn\u2019t exactly\ntaken off like a rocket. Why? It\u2019s been a bit of a hassle\u2014think clunky gear,\nhigh prices, and a steep learning curve. But hold up! With the drop of Apple\nVision Pro\u2014a next-level mixed reality headset\u2014things are about to get real.\nThis could be the game-changer that finally makes AR/VR the go-to for brands\nlooking to level up their marketing game.\n\n## **What 's holding back AR/VR adoption? Let\u2019s talk the hurdles and how to\nsmash through them!**\n\nDespite the excitement surrounding AR and VR, these technologies face several\nhurdles that have kept them from becoming mainstream. One major challenge is\nthe physical discomfort associated with VR headsets. Many users experience\nmotion sickness, eye strain, and headaches after extended use. The bulky and\ncumbersome design of many VR devices can also make them uncomfortable to wear\nfor long periods, limiting the time users are willing to spend in virtual\nenvironments and reducing the technology's effectiveness as a marketing tool.\n\nAnother significant barrier is the high cost of AR and VR devices. Quality\nheadsets and devices often come with a hefty price tag, restricting their\naccessibility to a small segment of the market. For brands aiming to reach a\nbroader audience, this presents a considerable challenge. The financial\ninvestment required for both consumers and companies to adopt these\ntechnologies has slowed their widespread integration into everyday marketing\nstrategies.\n\nFinally, the complexity of AR and VR technology adds to the adoption\nchallenges. Users frequently encounter a steep learning curve when trying to\nnavigate these new environments. The process of setting up and using AR/VR\ndevices can be daunting, requiring technical expertise that not everyone\npossesses. This complexity can lead to frustration and reluctance to fully\nengage with the technology, further impeding its broader adoption.\n\n## **Apple Vision Pro: A Game-Changer**\n\nApple, a company known for revolutionizing industries with its innovative\nproducts, has now entered the AR/VR market with its Vision Pro headset. This\ndevice is poised to overcome many of the challenges that have hindered the\nadoption of AR/VR and could be the catalyst that propels these technologies\ninto the mainstream.\n\n#### **1\\. Seamless Blending of Digital and Physical Worlds**\n\nThe Vision Pro is not just another VR headset; it represents a new category of\ndevice known as a \"spatial computer.\" It seamlessly integrates digital content\nwith the physical world, allowing users to interact with both simultaneously.\nThis ability to blend the virtual and real worlds without the need to\ncompletely disconnect from one's surroundings addresses one of the major pain\npoints of traditional VR\u2014its isolating nature. With Vision Pro, users can move\nfluidly between digital and physical spaces, enhancing the versatility and\nappeal of the technology.\n\n#### **2\\. Intuitive, No-Touch Controls**\n\nOne of the standout features of Vision Pro is its intuitive control system.\nUnlike traditional AR/VR devices that rely on physical controllers or\ntouchscreens, Vision Pro uses eye-tracking and hand gestures for navigation\nand interaction. Users can simply look at a virtual object and perform natural\ngestures, such as pinching their fingers, to interact with it. This no-touch\ncontrol system makes the device more accessible and user-friendly, reducing\nthe learning curve and making AR/VR more appealing to a broader audience.\n\n#### **3\\. Advanced Technology for a Superior Experience**\n\nVision Pro is packed with advanced technology designed to enhance the user\nexperience. It features five sensors, eye-tracking technology, a LiDAR\nscanner, 12 cameras, and six microphones, all of which work together to create\na highly responsive and immersive environment. The device runs on a new\noperating system called visionOS, which is entirely controlled by the user's\neyes, hands, and voice, eliminating the need for any physical input devices.\nThese innovations make Vision Pro not only more comfortable and intuitive to\nuse but also more powerful and capable of delivering truly immersive\nexperiences.\n\n## **How is AR/VR flipping the script on marketing?**\n\nAs AR/VR technology becomes more refined and accessible, the opportunities for\nmarketers to engage with customers in new and exciting ways are expanding.\nBelow are some of the key applications of AR/VR in marketing that could\nrevolutionize how brands interact with their audiences.\n\n#### **1\\. Product Visualization**\n\nOne of the most promising applications of AR/VR in marketing is product\nvisualization. With these technologies, customers can virtually try on\nproducts, such as clothing or accessories, or see how a piece of furniture\nwould look in their home before making a purchase. This not only enhances the\nshopping experience but also increases customer confidence in their purchase\ndecisions, leading to higher conversion rates. Brands like IKEA have already\nbegun to leverage this technology with their IKEA Place app, allowing users to\nplace virtual furniture in their real-world environment.\n\n#### **2\\. Interactive Storytelling**\n\nAR/VR offers brands the ability to create immersive narratives that engage\ncustomers on a deeper level. Through interactive storytelling, brands can\ntransport customers to different worlds, allowing them to experience a product\nor service in a way that goes beyond traditional advertising. This type of\nengagement can create a strong emotional connection with the brand, fostering\nloyalty and driving sales.\n\n#### **3\\. Virtual Events**\n\nIn the era of remote work and virtual gatherings, AR/VR can take virtual\nevents to the next level. These technologies enable brands to host virtual\nconferences, product launches, and other events in immersive environments that\nprovide a more engaging and interactive experience for attendees. This can be\nparticularly valuable for reaching global audiences and creating a sense of\npresence and community, even when participants are physically distant.\n\n#### **4\\. Accessibility**\n\nBeyond marketing, AR/VR has the potential to improve accessibility for people\nwith disabilities. The intuitive controls and minimal physical interaction\nrequired by devices like Vision Pro can make digital content more accessible\nto individuals with physical limitations. For example, the combination of eye\nmovement and simple hand gestures could enable users with limited mobility to\ninteract with digital environments in ways that were previously impossible.\nThis not only broadens the audience for AR/VR experiences but also enhances\ninclusivity, allowing brands to reach a more diverse range of customers.\n\n## **Transform Your Brand with Cutting-Edge Immersive Technologie** s\n\nAt Simelabs, we are at the forefront of the immersive technology revolution,\noffering expertise in Metaverse development, Digital Twin creation, Augmented\nReality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality (MR), and cutting-edge\nResearch.

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Exploring robots and its practical applications in a variety of fields.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# The Robotics Future in the Next Few Years.\n\nTechnology has advanced rapidly in the last decade, particularly in the field\nof robotics. Sweeping robots patrol our living rooms; interactive robots\naccompany our children; industrial robots assemble vehicles; rescue robots\nsearch for and save lives in disasters; and medical robots perform surgeries\nin hospitals are all examples of how robots are changing our lives. In fact,\ntop tech companies are constantly competing to change how robotics is\nimplemented in people's daily lives, paving the way for a truly exciting\nfuture.\n\nConsumer electronics and the electric vehicle industry have contributed to the\ncreation of millions of new jobs in the robotics industry over the last\ndecade, and by 2025, robotics will be worth $100 billion, equal to the tourism\nindustry. For example, thanks to advancements in rehab/therapy robots, active\nprostheses, exoskeletons, and wearable robotics, the rehabilitation robot\nmarket grew tenfold between 2010 and 2016.\n\nIn short, robotics will become critical components in a variety of\napplications over the next decade, and robots combined with AI will be able to\nperform complex actions while learning from humans, propelling the intelligent\nautomation phenomenon. As a result, we attempt to depict the direction and\napplication fields of such an important sector of future markets. Robots have\naided people in better understanding and investigating space, as well as\nmaking educational innovation more accessible. Some robots have even developed\nthe ability to physically evolve. These new developments are exciting, and\ndespite the concerns of some critics about their ability to become completely\nself-contained, robotics has made our lives much easier. The advancement of\nrobotic technology is particularly useful and profound in the field of\nmedicine, where precision is required to save patients' lives. Robotics has\nadvanced to the point where it can now be integrated into human life in a\nvariety of ways. Robots have the potential to reshape the way businesses are\nrun, and they are designed to give businesses more automation capabilities.\n\n### **Types of robots**\n\nAlthough the concept of robots has been around for a long time, it is only in\nthe last few decades that they have become more complex and useful. Robots now\nhave a wide range of practical applications in a variety of fields.\n\nSome of these types of robots, as discussed in our open step on robot\napplications, include:\n\n  * Industrial. The most common application of robots is in simple, repetitive industrial tasks. Assembly line processes, picking and packing, welding, and other similar functions are examples. They are dependable, accurate, and quick.\n  * Military. Military forces all over the world now use robots in areas like UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), UGVs (Unmanned Ground Vehicles), triage, and surveillance, thanks to recent developments.\n  * Service. The personal service industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors in robotics. Manual tasks such as food dispensing and cleaning are examples of applications.\n  * Exploration. Robots are frequently used to access hostile or otherwise inaccessible areas. Space exploration, such as the Curiosity Rover on Mars, is a good example of exploratory robots.\n  * Hazardous conditions. Again, certain environments, such as disaster zones, high-radiation areas, and extreme environments, can be hazardous to humans.\n  * Medical. Medtech robots are being used in a variety of ways in the healthcare industry. Whether it's assisting with surgery, rehabilitation, or physiotherapy, or managing laboratory specimens.\n  * Entertainment. People are increasingly purchasing robots for entertainment (especially during the pandemic). There are a variety of popular toy robots, as well as robot restaurants and massive robot statues.\n\nProfessional service applications will account for a significant portion of\nthe market, based on demand. Customer behaviour changes have emerged as a\nmajor driver of the industry's growth. For example, in the fields of\nmanufacturing customization and logistics, delivery services and online\nmarketplaces have increased demand for robotics. The recent need to automate\nan increasing number of food delivery operations has resulted in a rise in\nrobotic methods' use in these fields. Rovers were developed to transport food\norders to customers all over the world as soon as demand and automation were\nrecognised and implemented in the food industry. More companies are using\ndelivery robots, incorporating robotics into various aspects of restaurant\noperations, and so on. Looking ahead to the future of robotics, this trend is\nlikely to continue and spread to more industries.\n\n\"_Pizzas will not be delivered by teenagers hoping for a tip_ ,\" Stowe Boyd,\nlead researcher for GigaOM Research, predicted. _Because so many people will\nlose their jobs to 'bots,' food will be raised by robotic vehicles, even in\nsmall plot urban farms, which will become the norm. A battery of Watson-grade\nAIs will review your X-rays, and humans will only be called in if the machines\ndisagree.\u201c_\n\n### **CONCLUSION**\n\nTechnologies are gradually moving away from replacing manual labour and toward\nmaking existing manufacturing processes more efficient. Waste recycling\nprocesses will be optimised in response to consumer demand for environmentally\nfriendly manufacturing, and more complex solutions for \"intelligent\" sorting\nand distribution of recyclable materials and industrial waste will emerge. We\nmust keep in mind that there is already a scarcity of manual labour on the\nmarket, and that in a number of complex spheres where operational\nrepeatability is low, technological solutions such as AI are required.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Explore more points on the most debated topic of artificial intelligence and how it changes the job market.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Learn about AI and its effect on the job market\n\nArtificial intelligence is currently one of the most researched and sought-\nafter topics on the planet. The pattern and history of online searches clearly\nshow that AI is not a recent development; it has been around for over 70\nyears. But what makes it different is that we now have a cost-effective way to\nstore, transfer, and compute massive amounts of data in ways that were\npreviously not possible. One of AI's most significant advantages, according to\nmany experts of the World Economic Forum, is its ability to relieve people of\ntiresome repetitive duties that are part of their overall responsibilities,\nallowing them to focus on more difficult and rewarding projects \u2014 or simply\ntake some much-needed time off. As a result, fresh research is being\nundertaken every day, and new thought experiments and ideas on how to\nconstruct stronger AI to service people's lives are emerging every day.\n\nSo what does this signify? It means that there is going to be a paradigm shift\ntowards  \u201cjobs of tomorrow\u201d. Hence, instead of a software engineer there would\nbe more in need of an automation engineer. The jobs do not change, but the\nstyle of requirement would. Hence, more jobs with higher specialisation would\nbe of rise rather than jobs that require menial skills.\n\n### **Artificial intelligence and Data science****\n\nData is an asset to businesses, but only if it is processed effectively. In\ntoday's digital era, data engineering, data science, and artificial\nintelligence are trendy technologies that are widely spoken about. Human\nperceptions of problems have changed as a result of these technological\nadvancements. Big volumes of data are used in today's enterprises, and\ntraditional business intelligence techniques fall short when processing large\namounts of data at once. This is where data science advancements come into\nplay by offering more sophisticated capabilities for handling vast volumes of\nunstructured data. Financial logs, multimedia files, marketing forms, sensor\ndata, text files, etc. stores valuable data.\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Data Science are intricately related technologies.\nArtificial intelligence is the study of data and the creation of intelligent\nsystems using tools. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide concept aiming at\ndeveloping intelligent machines that can emulate human cognition and behavior.\nData Science makes use of and analyses this data in order to gain insights.\nAlthough Data Science and Artificial Intelligence have largely supplanted\ntechnological automation, they still need the collaboration of Data\nEngineering. The process of obtaining and processing data for use by Data\nScience and Artificial Intelligence is known as Data Engineering. Data science\nand artificial intelligence are rapidly progressing, and they are predicted to\naid further in the fourth industrial revolution. Machine learning is an\nartificial intelligence field that allows computers to learn from data without\nbeing explicitly programmed.\n\nMachine learning is an application or subset of AI that allows machines to\nlearn from data without being explicitly programmed. AI is a larger concept\nthat aims to create intelligent machines that can simulate human thinking\ncapability and behavior. Machine learning is focused on allowing a machine to\nlearn/decide and improve its performance, whereas artificial intelligence is\nconcerned with generating intelligent devices/computers.\n\n### **Artificial intelligence and future of job market****\n\nAs automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies become\nmore widely used, the role of humans in the economy is expected to decline\ndrastically, resulting in the loss of millions of jobs. Furthermore, COVID-19\nenhanced this impact in 2020, which will most likely promote digitalization in\nsome industries and maybe establish it permanently. This might have an impact\non a country's full-time equivalent (FTE) workforce, as well as the number of\ncollege graduates, retirement, mortality, and migration rates. For both supply\nand demand, this comprises standardized job taxonomy at the granular level.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that posts like software engineers and data\nanalysts, as well as technological job requirements like cloud computing,\nmobile application development, software testing, and artificial intelligence,\nare in high demand across all industries and locations. However, a number of\nhighly \"automatable\" jobs are among the top ten most falling occupations,\ni.e., those with the lowest percentage of hiring. Administrative assistants,\ncustomer service representatives, accountants, and electrical/mechanical\nspecialists are among the vocations that rely on repetitive duties. By 2025,\nit's expected that the quantity of work done by machines will have increased\nfrom 29% to over 50%, but this rapid change will be accompanied by new labor-\nmarket needs that may result in more jobs, rather than fewer. These forecasts\n\"[offer] causes for both excitement and caution,\" according to the reports of\nthe World Economic Forum.\n\nAccording to recent research by World Economic Forum on the future of jobs, AI\nis more of an optimizer than it is intelligent in the sense that we think of\nhumans as intelligent, based on the current state-of-the-art. Human\nintelligence includes inference, planning, and cross-domain knowledge, as well\nas common sense and the ability to debate, as well as self-awareness and\ncompassion. The most important feature is that the internet behemoths are\nclearly winning, with Google coming in first, Facebook coming in second, and\nChina's Baidu $0.10 Alibaba coming in third in terms of the revenue generated.\nThese users have the most data, which is what AI runs on. By gathering so much\ndata, AI's user base expands, allowing them to earn more money, which in turn\nallows them to hire more scientists, who in turn buy more machines, and so on.\nWith the advent of the pandemic, things have shifted even further. Workers are\nfacing a 'double-disruption' scenario as a result of automation and the\nCOVID-19 recession. By 2025, technological adoption by businesses will\ntransform tasks, jobs, and skills, in addition to the current disruption\ncaused by pandemic-induced lockdowns and economic contraction. It's critical\nthat we think about how to retrain displaced people, how to educate our\nchildren and future generations about how to avoid becoming displaced, and how\nto change society's values, all of which require more human compassion.\nEspecially in the times of work-from-home culture.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/tag/ble/", "title": "BLE Archives - Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# BLE\n\n##  GoShop app- Hyperlocal shopping mall app\n\nApril 22, 2020 8:24 am\n\n##  GoShop\n\nApril 21, 2020 3:29 am\n\nFind the best places for shopping with our mall finder!

Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Case Study | How Data Science Transforms Pharma Survival Analysis\n\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of healthcare, understanding patient\noutcomes and improving treatment efficacy has become paramount. Among the\nstatistical tools available to researchers and pharmaceutical companies,\nsurvival analysis stands out as a powerful method for predicting the duration\nuntil an event of interest occurs\u2014be it patient survival, treatment failure,\nor disease recurrence. With the advent of data science, the capabilities of\nsurvival analysis have expanded dramatically, enabling pharmaceutical\ncompanies to leverage vast amounts of data to derive insights that were once\nunattainable.\n\n### **What is Survival Analysis?**\n\nSurvival analysis is a specialized branch of statistics focused on analyzing\ntime-to-event data. In healthcare, this typically involves assessing patient\nsurvival rates, the time until disease progression, or the occurrence of\nspecific health-related events. Key characteristics of survival analysis\ninclude:\n\n  * **Censoring** : This refers to incomplete data, which occurs when a patient drops out of a study or when the study concludes before the event of interest is observed. This is crucial because traditional statistical methods that don't account for censoring can lead to biased results.\n  * **Survival Function** : This function estimates the probability of survival past a certain time. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a common non-parametric method used to create survival curves that visually represent survival probabilities over time.\n\n## **Case Study : Analysing Drug Effectiveness Using Hazard Models**\n\nIn a recent project, we collaborated with a leading biopharmaceutical company\nspecializing in six therapeutic areas: cardiovascular disease, oncology, bone\nhealth, neuroscience, nephrology, and inflammation. The company aimed to\nperform a survival analysis on one of its cancer drugs to understand the\nimpact of various feature variables on patient survival. By calculating a\nhazard ratio, we were able to assess the probability of survival at specific\ntime intervals.\n\n**Goals 1 : Perform Survival Analysis Using the Kaplan-Meier Model**  \nWe focused on calculating the median survival time for patients undergoing\ntreatment with the cancer drug. The Kaplan-Meier estimator allowed us to\ngenerate survival curves, providing a clear visualization of how patient\nsurvival rates changed over time. This helped the company understand the\ndrug's effectiveness in different patient clusters and allowed healthcare\nprofessionals to make informed decisions.\n\n**Goal 2 : Identify Impact of Feature Variables with the Proportional Hazards\nModel**  \nIn addition to survival estimates, the company wanted to explore how certain\nfeatures, such as comorbidities and compound therapies, influenced survival\noutcomes. Using the Cox Proportional Hazards model, we calculated hazard\nratios to quantify the relative risk posed by these variables. This analysis\nprovided valuable insights into the factors that most significantly impacted\npatient survival, enabling more personalized treatment strategies.\n\n### **Solution Components**\n\nTo effectively perform survival analysis and derive actionable insights,\nseveral key components are employed:\n\n**Survival Analysis** : This encompasses the methodologies used to analyze\ntime-to-event data. Key techniques include the Kaplan-Meier estimator for\nvisualizing survival probabilities and the Cox Proportional Hazards model for\nassessing the impact of covariates on survival outcomes.\n\n**Hazards Models** : Specifically, the Proportional Hazards model is used to\ncalculate hazard ratios that help quantify the risk associated with different\npatient features. This allows the pharmaceutical company to identify which\nvariables significantly affect survival, enabling more targeted treatment\napproaches.\n\n**Databricks** : A powerful cloud-based platform for data engineering and\nanalytics, Databricks provides an integrated environment for processing large\ndatasets and running complex analytics. By leveraging Apache Spark, the\ncompany can efficiently handle the massive volumes of data generated in\nclinical trials, enabling rapid analysis and model training.\n\n**AI/ML** : Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) play\ncritical roles in enhancing the capabilities of survival analysis. These\ntechnologies facilitate the development of advanced predictive models that can\nhandle high-dimensional data, enabling more accurate predictions of patient\noutcomes. Machine learning algorithms can also automate feature selection and\nidentify complex interactions between variables that may influence survival.\n\n**Classification Models** : Beyond survival analysis, classification models\ncan be employed to categorize patients based on risk factors or treatment\nresponses. For example, using classification techniques such as logistic\nregression or decision trees, researchers can classify patients into high-risk\nand low-risk groups. This stratification helps in tailoring treatment plans\nand interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes.\n\n### **How Data Science Enhances Survival Analysis**\n\n**Data Handling and Preprocessing** : In pharmaceutical research, data comes\nfrom various sources, including clinical trials, electronic health records\n(EHRs), and patient-reported outcomes. Data science techniques, such as data\ncleaning, transformation, and integration, are vital for preparing this\ncomplex dataset. Ensuring high-quality data is essential, as inaccuracies can\nlead to flawed conclusions.\n\n**Advanced Algorithms** : While traditional survival analysis models like\nKaplan-Meier and Cox regression are foundational, data science opens the door\nto more sophisticated algorithms. Machine learning methods, such as random\nsurvival forests or survival support vector machines, can handle high-\ndimensional data and uncover complex relationships between multiple variables,\nimproving predictive accuracy and offering deeper insights into patient\noutcomes.\n\n**Feature Engineering and Selection** : Effective survival analysis relies\nheavily on the identification of relevant predictors. Data science facilitates\nautomated feature selection techniques, which help in identifying the most\nsignificant variables affecting survival. For instance, integrating genetic\nmarkers or treatment protocols as features can provide a richer context for\nunderstanding patient outcomes.\n\n**Real-Time Predictive Analytics** : Integrating AI and machine learning with\nsurvival models can transform them into real-time predictive systems. For\nexample, the biopharmaceutical company can monitor ongoing clinical trial data\ncontinuously and update survival predictions as new information becomes\navailable. This agility allows researchers to adapt their strategies\ndynamically, enhancing decision-making during drug development.\n\n**Simulation and Risk Assessment** : By employing simulation techniques,\nresearchers can create virtual patient cohorts to explore various scenarios\nwithout conducting new clinical trials. This is particularly useful in\nassessing the long-term implications of treatment strategies, such as\nadjusting dosages or testing combination therapies. Additionally, data-driven\nrisk assessments enable more tailored treatment plans based on individual\npatient profiles.\n\n### **Ethical and Regulatory Considerations**\n\nWhile data science offers innovative approaches to survival analysis, it also\nraises ethical and regulatory challenges. The pharmaceutical industry is\nheavily regulated, and ensuring compliance with laws like HIPAA (Health\nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act) and GDPR (General Data\nProtection Regulation) is crucial when handling sensitive patient data.\nTransparency and explainability of complex models are essential for gaining\nregulatory approval and fostering public trust in new therapies.\n\n### **The Future of Survival Analysis in Pharmaceuticals**\n\nAs technology continues to evolve, so too will survival analysis\nmethodologies. The integration of big data, cloud computing, and artificial\nintelligence will significantly enhance the ability to discover new drugs and\nimprove patient outcomes. We can expect survival models to become even more\nsophisticated and personalized, ushering in a new era of precision medicine\nwhere treatment plans are tailored to the unique characteristics of individual\npatients.\n\n### **Conclusion: Advancing Research**\n\nSurvival analysis is an invaluable tool for pharmaceutical companies looking\nto enhance patient outcomes and make informed decisions. By leveraging the\npower of data science, organizations can push the boundaries of traditional\nsurvival analysis, unlocking new opportunities in clinical trials and real-\nworld applications. The combination of established statistical methods with\nmodern data science techniques is pivotal in driving better insights and\nshaping the future of healthcare.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Tap the link to learn more.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Mint an NFT in a decentralized manner\u2014 using Alchemy, Ethers.js & Pinata\nAPIs\n\nChikku George Software Engineer | ReactJs | NodeJs | NestJs\n\nA guide on how to mint an NFT in a decentralized manner by the use of alchemy,\nethers.js, and pinata\n\n _As part of this article, we are trying to mint an NFT on the server side\n(nodejs) using alchemy, ethers.js and pinata apis on Polygon Mumbai Testnet._\n\nMinting an NFT is like placing our digital assets onto the blockchain so that\nthey can be traded in NFT marketplaces.\n\nAs per blockchain, NFT is like a transaction of metadata. So apparently,\nminting an NFT is the process of executing that transaction on the blockchain.\n\n### **How the NFT Minting Architecture looks?**\n\nNFT Architecture\n\n### **Alchemy**\n\nAlchemy is a middleware that makes blockchain communication easier for\ndevelopers.\n\nCreate a free account on Alchemy https://www.alchemy.com/ and use their\ndevelopment platform and APIs to request the blockchain.\n\n### **Alchemy account setup**\n\nAlchemy Sign Up or Sign In\n\nCreate a new app on alchemy by choosing the required blockchain network.\n\nCreate a new app on Alchemy\n\nCopy the HTTP URL as we need it to connect to the blockchain network.\n\nView app key details on Alchemy\n\n _Now, we need to add Polygon Mumbai testnet to your metamask account._\n\nAdd the Alchemy URL as RPC URL and set chain ID as 80001. You can verify the\nchain ID in https://chainlist.org/. MATIC is the token handled in polygon\nblockchain.\n\nPolygon Mumbai Testnet on Metamask\n\n### **Ethers.js**\n\nEthers.js is a library that allows us to interact with the Ethereum\nblockchain.\n\nInstall ethers.js as below:\n\n    \n    \n    **npm install --save ethers**\n\n _Minting an NFT in a decentralized manner, how? \u2014using IPFS, a decentralized\nstorage platform, where we will be storing our NFT metadata._\n\n### **IPFS & Pinata**\n\nIPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a peer-to-peer protocol like torrent.  \nIt decentralizes the entire file hosting process. When we upload a file to\nIPFS, it gets distributed across every node which then becomes a server so\nthat no one can take down a file. We are hosting our NFT metadata on IPFS.\n\nPinata is an interface of IPFS that makes it easier to host files on IPFS.  \nWe can upload image files as well as JSON metadata to the Pinata.\n\nCreate a free account on pinata: https://app.pinata.cloud/signin.\n\nPinata Register or Sign In\n\nCreate new API key to access it. You will get an API key as well as a secret\nkey.\n\nCreate API key on Pinata\n\n _Now let\u2019s delve into NFT minting!_\n\n### **Step 1: Get some fake MATIC**\n\nAs blockchain transactions are bound to gas fees, we need to collect some fake\nMATIC to mint our NFT.\n\nGet some fake MATIC from here: https://faucet.polygon.technology/.\n\nOther MATIC faucets available:\n\n  1. https://faucet.pearzap.com/\n  2. https://matic.supply/\n  3. https://www.coinclarified.com/tools/faucets/polygon\n  4. https://faucet.firebird.finance/\n\n### **Step 2: Create a .env file**\n\nThe .env file should contain the following details:\n\n    \n    \n    **API_URL = \u201cyour alchemy URL\"**  \n    **PRIVATE_KEY = \u201cmetamask private key\u201d**  \n    **PUBLIC_KEY = \u201cyour metamask wallet address\u201d**  \n    **CONTRACT_ADDRESS =\u201ddeployed contract address\"**  \n    **PINATA_API_KEY = \u201cpinata api key\u201d**  \n    **PINATA_SECRET_KEY = \u201cpinata secret key\u201d**\n\n### **Step 3: Create your nft.js file**\n\nCopy the following content to the file.\n\n    \n    \n    **require(\"dotenv\").config();  \n     const fs = require(\"fs\");  \n    const FormData = require(\"form-data\");  \n    const axios = require(\"axios\");  \n    const { ethers } = require(\"ethers\");****//Grab the contract ABI  \n     const contract = require(\"../artifacts/contracts/ArGram.sol/ArGram.json\");**  \n    **const {  \n     PINATA_API_KEY,  \n     PINATA_SECRET_KEY,  \n     API_URL,  \n     PRIVATE_KEY,  \n     PUBLIC_KEY,  \n     CONTRACT_ADDRESS  \n    } = process.env;**\n\nFirstly, make sure you have successfully authenticated the Pinata API.\n\n    \n    \n    **const authResponse = await    axios.get(\"https://api.pinata.cloud/data/testAuthentication\", {  \n            headers: {  \n               pinata_api_key: PINATA_API_KEY,  \n               pinata_secret_api_key: PINATA_SECRET_KEY,  \n            },  \n    });**\n\nYour _authResponse  _should contain a message like \u201c _Congratulations!

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Discover how AI is revolutionizing the telecom industry by transforming customer engagement, improving service efficiency, and personalizing user experiences. From AI chatbots to predictive analytics, explore how telecom companies are enhancing customer satisfaction and streamlining operations.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nThe telecom industry is undergoing a massive transformation, driven by\nadvanced technology that is redefining customer interactions. Companies are\nnow able to streamline customer service, predict issues before they occur, and\noffer highly personalized deals tailored to individual needs. With real-time\ndata analysis and automation, telecom providers can anticipate customer\ndemands, resolve concerns faster, and enhance overall user experiences. From\nintelligent chatbots offering instant support to predictive systems optimizing\nnetwork performance, innovation is making telecom services smarter, more\nefficient, and deeply customer-centric.\n\n### Enhancing Customer Experience with AI\n\nImagine trying to get a new phone plan or dealing with an unexpected service\nissue. Traditionally, these processes could be slow and frustrating. However,\ntelecom companies are now leveraging AI to make these interactions smoother\nand more efficient. Two key areas where AI is driving change are lead-to-\norder, which simplifies the process of acquiring new customers by predicting\ntheir needs and guiding them toward the right services, and trouble-to-\nresolve, which reduces wait times and improves problem resolution through AI-\ndriven automation and predictive maintenance.\n\n### AI-Powered Solutions Driving Customer Engagement\n\nSeveral AI-driven innovations are leading this transformation. Predictive\nanalytics enables AI to anticipate customer needs before they even ask,\noffering relevant solutions proactively. AI chatbots serve as virtual\nassistants that provide 24/7 support, answering common queries and resolving\nissues without human intervention. Personalized offers, powered by AI, analyze\ncustomer behavior to deliver tailored deals, eliminating irrelevant promotions\nand improving customer engagement.\n\n### The Benefits of AI in Telecom\n\nBy integrating AI into their operations, telecom companies are experiencing\nimproved customer satisfaction through faster issue resolution and\npersonalized interactions. AI enhances efficiency by automating routine tasks,\nallowing human agents to focus on more complex issues. Additionally, AI\ncontributes to cost savings by reducing operational expenses and optimizing\nresource allocation, leading to better financial performance.\n\n### Overcoming the Challenges\n\nWhile AI presents significant advantages, implementing it in telecom is not\nwithout hurdles. Data complexity remains a challenge as customer information\nis scattered across multiple systems, making it difficult to extract\nmeaningful insights. Legacy systems further complicate the integration of\nmodern AI solutions, often requiring costly updates. The growing demand for AI\nexpertise highlights skill gaps in the industry, making it essential to invest\nin talent development. Privacy and security concerns also require careful\nattention to protect customer data and ensure AI-generated information is\naccurate and reliable.\n\n### A Strategic Approach to AI Adoption\n\nTo navigate these challenges, telecom companies are adopting a phased\napproach. They are starting small by deploying AI-driven virtual assistants\nand automation tools to enhance customer support. Scaling strategically is\ncrucial, with a clear roadmap in place to expand AI capabilities across\ndifferent operations. Many are also leveraging prebuilt AI models to\naccelerate implementation and reduce costs, allowing for faster innovation and\ncompetitive advantage.\n\n### The Future of AI in Telecom\n\nAI is not about replacing people; it\u2019s about enhancing efficiency and\ndelivering a better experience for customers. By embracing AI thoughtfully and\nstrategically, telecom companies can unlock new opportunities for growth,\ninnovation, and customer satisfaction. The industry is evolving rapidly, and\nthose who adapt to this AI-driven transformation will be well-positioned for\nlong-term success.\n\nNext  __\n\n### Case Study | AI Powered Travel Itinerary App Transforming Luxury Travel Planning\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Case Study | Clinical Trial Compliance Simplified with One Solution for Adverse Event Reporting\n\nIn the pharmaceutical and clinical trials industry, staying compliant with\nglobal regulations is a formidable challenge. Pharmaceutical companies and\nclinical trial sponsors face a constantly shifting regulatory landscape, with\neach country enforcing its own set of requirements for adverse event reporting\nand compliance. This complexity makes it difficult to efficiently consolidate\nreporting timelines and requirements across multiple countries.\n\nTo address these challenges, a centralized, automated solution was developed.\nThis solution simplifies the process by providing streamlined access to\nverified regulatory data through a single endpoint. Leveraging a REST API, it\nensures that pharmaceutical companies and clinical trial sponsors can easily\naccess accurate and trustworthy data for adverse event reporting requirements,\nno matter where in the world they operate.\n\n### **The Need for a Centralized Regulatory Compliance Solution**\n\nClinical trial sponsors often struggle to navigate the intricate regulatory\nrequirements that vary widely between countries. Each regulatory body has its\nown procedures and timelines, making compliance a time-intensive and costly\nprocess. Furthermore, maintaining data integrity is paramount to ensuring\ncompliance, as any discrepancy could lead to significant consequences,\nincluding penalties and delays in market approvals.\n\nThe solution was crafted to address these pain points by centralizing\ninformation through validated, reliable data sourced from regulatory websites.\nBy consolidating the data in a structured, easy-to-access format, clinical\ntrial sponsors and pharmaceutical companies can now access the latest\nregulatory information without navigating a maze of websites and documents.\n\n### **Building an Automated Solution for Real-Time Regulatory Insights**\n\nThe primary objective of this solution was to create a system that could\nautomatically collect regulatory data related to adverse event reporting,\nconsolidating timelines, industry obligations, and country-specific\nprocedures. Data integrity was a top priority, and to ensure it, only official\nand validated sources were used. The result is a structured and accessible\nformat that can be queried by users across the globe.\n\nA highly automated process, powered by a web-crawling module, was implemented\nto gather and index data from official regulatory websites in over 159\ncountries. Using Google Custom Search API, the system was able to retrieve\nrelevant sublinks and keywords for indexing. This indexed data was then stored\nin a vector database, enabling quick and efficient querying.\n\nTo facilitate the extraction of specific information, such as timelines and\nresponsibilities, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline was\nestablished in collaboration with OpenAI. This pipeline allowed for the\nextraction and validation of critical information, which was subsequently\nindexed in the database for future use. With this data accessible through a\nREST API, clients can now easily query country-specific reporting timelines,\nindustry obligations, and procedures.\n\n### **Key Benefits & Outcomes**\n\nThe development of this solution has significantly streamlined the reporting\nprocesses for clinical trial sponsors and pharmaceutical companies. Key\nbenefits of the solution include:\n\n  * **Centralized Access to Regulatory Data** : Clients can access a single endpoint to retrieve comprehensive regulatory requirements, reducing the time and effort needed to gather information manually.\n  * **Enhanced Compliance** : By relying on validated data from official regulatory websites, the system ensures that clients always have access to accurate information, reducing the risk of compliance violations.\n  * **Real-Time Adaptation** : The solution continuously adapts to regulatory updates, ensuring that clients stay compliant with the latest requirements.\n  * **Efficiency and Cost Savings** : Automating the data collection and validation process allows companies to allocate resources more efficiently, focusing on core activities instead of regulatory research.\n\nThis solution ultimately provides clients with the structured, trustworthy\ninformation necessary for informed decision-making and effective regulatory\ncompliance. It streamlines complex processes, maintains data accuracy, and\nenables real-time adaptability to new regulations as they arise.\n\n### **Ready to Streamline Your Regulatory Compliance?**\n\n**If you\u2019re a clinical trial sponsor or pharmaceutical company looking to\nsimplify your regulatory compliance processes, our centralized adverse event\nreporting solution can provide the trusted, real-time data you need. By\nleveraging automation, AI-driven insights, and a user-friendly REST API, we\nhelp you navigate global regulatory landscapes with ease and confidence.**\n\nReach out today to see how this powerful solution can support your compliance\nneeds, save time, and drive efficiency in your regulatory operations.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

It is poised to change the IT field in a very drastic\nmanner and is turning out to be the new internet. This trend of blockchain has\narisen due to its varied features which include enhanced security, corruption-\nfree, decentralised technology, distributed ledgers, faster settlement. It has\na wide variety of applications and hence used in many banks and industries and\nnow they are also being used in educational institutions. It's really an\nunderstatement that education is important. Education is an important part of\none\u2019s life which acts as the greatest weapon to improve their life. It\ndetermines the quality of a person's life and also affects their attitude,\nknowledge, manners, skills. Future of the country in any field like medicine,\nengineering, farming depends on the advancements in education. It's important\nto create a transparent and secured educational system.\n\n## What is Blockchain?\n\nIt is a group of records of data called blocks which are linked using\ncryptography. These records are immutable and managed by a group of computers\nrather than a single entity and are very secure. Blocks on the blockchain are\nmade of digital pieces of information. It is an open, distributed and\nimmutable file which is accessible by everyone. It is a simple way of passing\ninformation in a simple and completely automated manner. This is a\ndecentralised chain where everyone is given equal access at the same time. It\nis a very promising technology which reduces risk and brings out transparency.\nIt can be used to denote a transfer of money, ownerships, identities,\ntransactions. It requires verification from several devices like computers\ndistributed around the net. Blocks of data cannot be disputed, removed or\naltered without the knowledge of its owners and the wider community.\n\n##  What are the challenges faced in the education sector?\n\nThe economic growth of a country not only depends on the capital and natural\nresources available but also on the quality of manpower which involves\neducation. But in recent days we see that our educational sector is facing a\nlot of challenges which include ease availability of fake diplomas, unable to\nreplace the missing certificates and many more. There are millions of students\nlearning in different institutions. It is a difficult task to store the\nrecords of all the students and maintaining their privacy is yet another task.\nIf the data is stored in a paper it has no guarantee to stay for this long\ntime and even if it exists it is a tedious task to find the old data. The\ncertificates must be verified by industries and educational institutions as\nthere is a risk of fake diplomas being used. It's impossible to prove the\ncredibility of a certificate at this point in time.\n\n##  How can Blockchain help an education sector?\n\nBy using blockchain, information is distributed among many computers rather\nthan being stored in a single entity. Every entry in this blockchain is\nimmutable. Once the information is fed it can be changed. It provides secured\nand cheap ways of storing data which involves years and years of certificates.\nIn this way, students and educational institutions gain control and ownership\nof all their education data and there is no fear of information getting\ncorrupted. It eliminates fraud and fake degrees by avoiding manual\nverification of these documents. This has brought up an innovative way of\ncollaborating business and educational institutions By using blockchain we can\navoid human intervention to control and manage records. This technology has\nhelped in boosting the efficiency of the processes being carried out.\n\nSo the application of block chain in education sector is as follows:\n\n  * Storage of all student records\n  * Identity verification\n  * Credit transfers\n  * Micro-Credentialing and Ownership of leaning Credentials\n\n## Blockchain cases in education\n\n### Storing Student Credentials\n\nMost educational institutions maintain their records in the custodial form.\nThese could be accessed only by the institutions' staff. Most of the\ninstitutions have a centralised system for storing all the student records.\nSince stored in a single system, there is an increased risk of losing data.\nNow when we consider blockchain, records such as degrees and course\ncertificates are secured and verified. Moreover, not only the institution\nstaff but everybody has access to these records. Even if the institution where\nthe degree was provided closed or if the entire university collapsed, the\nrecords are always well preserved by the blockchain. Certificate can prove its\nauthenticity itself in a blockchain.\n\n### Identity Verification\n\nIt is another problem which should be taken care of as it can cause data\ntampering and may even demand human intervention. Blockchain does not store\nthe document containing the student\u2019s identity but instead, it stores\ninformation about the document. Now students, employees, job candidates can\nnow identify themselves. Moreover, it does protect their personal information\nand controls the storage. Only a few people responsible for verifying the\nidentity are responsible have access to these data. From now on, Institution\nno longer has to protect the system for access right. It also removes the fear\nof data breaches and the need for staff training on data protection.\n\n### Credit transfers\n\nWhen the students transfer to a new institution, for the students to gain\ntheir credits they need to repeat the courses in the new institution. Students\nneed to preserve and prove the certificates of those courses being completed\nin the previous institution. It is even more complicated when students are\ntransferring to a country where there is an entirely different language and\nthis can create barriers for credit transfer. Standards of record also vary in\ndifferent institutions or different countries. There are many agreements\nbetween institutions to recognise each other's credit but most of them are not\nrecognised. By using blockchain, if an agreement exists then it is taken as a\nblockchain contract and credits would be automatically provided to the\nstudents according to the conditions of the contract.\n\n### Micro-Credentialing and Ownership of learning credentials\n\nIt provides a flexible system for storing the student credentials as they move\nfrom one course to another throughout their career. By using blockchain\ncredentials cannot be modified. Thus it can be a more reliable and safe way of\nstoring credentials. It allows personal data to stay personal to the user.\nStudents have complete ownership of their educational data.

Tap the link learn more.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Lean Waste Management\n\nLean method is a corporate philosophy that emphasises standardisation and\nsimplicity of processes, as well as the elimination of waste in all forms\nduring continuous improvement. Lean practises may help firms improve\noperational efficiency and customer responsiveness, which can lead to\nincreased revenues.Lean manufacturing's main concept is straightforward: work\ntirelessly to eliminate waste from the production process. Another approach to\nthinking of lean manufacturing is as a set of tools, processes, and concepts\nthat have been shown to reduce waste in the manufacturing process. Lean\npractises may save tens of thousands of dollars. In addition to saving money\nand time, lean practices can free up resources to pursue other possibilities,\nsuch as new goods or services.\n\n\"Waste\" is usually described in Lean manufacturing as any action that does not\nbring value to the customer. Waste is defined as any needless step in a\nproduction process that does not benefit the consumer and so is not worth\npaying for. The goal of lean manufacturing is to eliminate waste from the\nproduction process. When waste is removed, all that remains are the processes\nnecessary to provide a satisfactory, now high-valued product to the consumer.\nEven though they didn't call it that, Henry Ford and his crew at Ford Motor\nCompany developed Lean along with the assembly line.\n\nThe Toyota Production System (TPS), or the original seven wastes:\ntransportation, inventory, motion, waiting, overproduction, extra-processing,\nand defects, was created by Dr. Taiichi Ohno and Toyota to improve and promote\nLean. After TPS was embraced in the Western World in the 1990s, the 8th waste\nof underutilized talent was added.\n\nThe Five Lean Principles are a tried-and-true way for incorporating lean into\nyour production process. These guidelines are useful because they assist you\nin achieving the following goals:\n\n  1. Examine your process through the eyes of your consumer and determine what they value.\n  2. Separate the phases and activities in the process that provide value from those that waste time and money.\n  3. Eliminate bottlenecks and delays by streamlining the process.\n  4. Adapt swiftly to changes in client demand by aligning with it.\n  5. Encourage an internal culture of excellence and constant progress.\n\nThe final result will be improved customer value, decreased waste, enhanced\nproductivity, a competitive edge, and, eventually, higher profitability.\n\n### **Exploring 8 Wastes of Lean**\n\n  * Transportation\n\nUnwanted product movement throughout the manufacturing process is referred to\nas transportation. It occurs as a result of an unplanned arrangement, and\nproducts are moved from one workstation to another without need.\n\n  * Inventory\n\nOverproduction of a semi-completed product that has to be finished. Sometimes\nthe consumer does not get the order or the order is canceled. As a result,\nthis sort of product is stored and referred to as waste. The advantage of\ninventory is that vendors will occasionally provide discounts on large\npurchases. Manpower and store costs are also involved in maintaining huge\ninventories, and there is a risk of product damage.\n\n  * Motion\n\nWorkers are transferring from one workstation to another without need,\nlengthening the manufacturing lead time. This form of unwelcome movement is\nregarded as waste. Waste in motion is created by excessive movement of\nemployees, vehicles, or machines. This includes running, lifting, reaching,\nbending, stretching, and moving. Repetitive motion activities should be\nreduced in order to enhance labour conditions and health and safety\nrequirements.\n\n  * Waiting\n\nThese are stretches of time when there is no value added to the product, such\nas when there is a time delay or when the product is idle. It is a waste of\nresources and demoralises personnel to have machines, men, and material wait.\nThe operator is waiting for his turn and does not receive material on time,\nwhich is a waste of time. 2) Due to an unbalanced line, machines remain idle.\n\n  * Over-production\n\nProduction is outnumbering consumption. Market demand is lower than\nconsumption, but companies are producing more to lower production costs. In\nthis situation, inventory costs are rising, and money is becoming scarce. As a\nresult, it is regarded as a waste. Overproduction refers to the production of\nextra items using a 'push creation process.' Overproduction has three\ncountermeasures. To begin with, using 'Takt Time' ensures that the output pace\namong workstations remains constant. Second, cutting down on idle time such as\nloading and unloading, as well as setup periods. Third, use a pull or 'Kanban'\napproach to decrease WIP.\n\n  * Over-processing\n\nOver-processing lengthens machining time, increases material handling time,\nand adds extra stages to the process. The cost of the product has increased as\na result of overprocessing, which the consumer will bear. Consider standard\ntask criteria for manufacturing to reduce overprocessing on items. Prior to\nbeginning work, always consider the client and generate product quantities in\naccordance with their needs, while attempting to avoid needless operations and\nmaking numbers whenever possible.\n\n  * Defects\n\nThe product is not made according to the customer's specifications and\ntolerances. Those goods are deemed garbage after passing quality inspection.\nWhen a product or substance is not appropriate for usage, it will reject it.\nMoney will be lost as a result of the defective product/material, and the\ndefective portion will not be reused.\n\n  * Non-utilized talent\n\nThis waste occurs when people's knowledge, skill, and skills are not\ncompletely used. People must be involved in the process so that they may\ndetect problems and suggest ways to improve it.\n\nLean thinking aims to eliminate any processes in the manufacturing or value\nchain that waste time, energy, or product, allowing the consumer to get high-\nquality items when needed. \"As needed\" suggests that there will be no\noverproduction, but rather that the correct amount of items will be produced\nand supplied to the client as demanded, eliminating waste. You might say that\nwhen lean principles are correctly implemented, we can accomplish more with\nless.\n\nWhen we think about applying lean thinking to any form of activity, we\nconstantly bring up the concept of waste. The other is physical waste, or\ngarbage in the traditional sense.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nMany Indian SMEs are facing intense competition from multinational\ncounterparts in the domestic as well as global markets due to the volatile and\ncomplicated business conditions. Because resource-based competitive advantages\nare no longer adequate in a modern environment, the notion of lean has gained\ntraction. As a result, if engineering industries in any region of the world\nare to compete successfully, lean is no longer a choice, but rather a need.\n\nLean Manufacturing (LM) creates a new opportunity for industry employees to\nproduce and maintain higher value based on their core business strengths.\nCapturing, collecting, and disseminating information throughout the whole\nbusiness unit is a big duty for senior management.\n\nAny industry's performance is determined by how well it manages its resources\nand puts them to use. The implementation of lean manufacturing through\nsuccessful lean methods is based on industry interpretations of past\nexperiences and current data. Lean manufacturing obstacles are real and\nintangible impediments that exist in the industry in the form of non-value-\nadding activities that obstruct the seamless adoption of lean (LMBs).\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/tag/blockchain/", "title": "Blockchain Archives - Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Blockchain\n\n##  The NFT Metaverse: A Growing Trend in the Blockchain Industry.\n\nMay 19, 2022 12:32 pm\n\nIntroduction Non-fungible tokens (NFT) indicate a person's ownership of\ndigital assets like social media postings,\n\n##  Blockchain and healthcare\n\nFebruary 18, 2022 9:56 am\n\nIn the field of medical technology, \"blockchain\" is one of the most prominent\nbuzzwords.

Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nIn the dynamic world of cloud computing, visibility and real-time insights are\nessential for maintaining application performance and system health. Whether\nyou're managing a handful of EC2 instances or orchestrating a complex\nmicroservices architecture across regions, observability is the backbone of\noperational excellence. This is where AWS CloudWatch becomes indispensable. As\nAmazon\u2019s native monitoring and observability service, CloudWatch equips\norganizations with the tools they need to track metrics, collect and analyze\nlogs, trigger alarms, and automate responses across their AWS environments.\n\nAWS CloudWatch is a centralized monitoring service that helps you understand\nwhat's happening within your AWS infrastructure. It collects data in the form\nof metrics and logs, which can be visualized and analyzed to make informed\ndecisions. CloudWatch provides deep observability into not only your AWS\nresources but also on-premise servers and applications through custom metric\npublishing. By continuously ingesting data in real time, it allows users to\nset up alerting systems, create insightful dashboards, and automate response\nmechanisms to system events\u2014ensuring that any deviation from expected\nperformance is caught and addressed swiftly.\n\n### **Core Capabilities of CloudWatch**\n\nOne of the foundational features of CloudWatch is its ability to track metrics\nfrom various AWS services like EC2, RDS, DynamoDB, Lambda, and more. These\nmetrics are collected automatically, with the option to publish custom ones to\ncapture business-specific performance indicators. In addition to metrics,\nCloudWatch Logs serves as a centralized repository for log files generated by\napplications, AWS services, or even hybrid environments. Logs can be queried\nusing CloudWatch Log Insights, which enables rapid troubleshooting, anomaly\ndetection, and trend analysis using a familiar SQL-like query syntax.\n\nAlarms in CloudWatch play a critical role in maintaining application\nreliability. By setting threshold-based conditions, users can be instantly\nalerted when system performance drops or specific errors occur. These alarms\ncan trigger actions such as sending notifications via Amazon SNS, initiating\nAuto Scaling actions, or executing automated Lambda scripts\u2014bringing agility\nand automation into incident response. CloudWatch Dashboards allow users to\nbuild real-time visualizations and monitor metrics from different sources on a\nsingle pane of glass. These dashboards are highly customizable and suitable\nfor developers, DevOps teams, and even executive stakeholders.\n\n### **Why AWS CloudWatch Stands Out**\n\nWhat makes CloudWatch especially powerful is its seamless integration within\nthe AWS ecosystem. Since it is a native service, there is no need for\nadditional infrastructure or third-party tools to start monitoring your\nresources. It offers low-latency data processing, near real-time updates, and\ncustomizable retention policies, all while adhering to AWS\u2019s security and\ncompliance standards. IAM integration ensures role-based access control, and\nencrypted data storage safeguards sensitive information.\n\nCloudWatch is also highly cost-effective. It follows a pay-as-you-go pricing\nmodel, so you only pay for what you monitor and store. This makes it scalable\nfor both startups and large enterprises. Moreover, it can serve as a central\nobservability hub not just for AWS resources but also for hybrid cloud\nenvironments, thanks to the ability to integrate with on-premise systems and\nthird-party services via APIs and the CloudWatch Agent.\n\n### **Practical Use Cases and Getting Started**\n\nAWS CloudWatch is used in a variety of scenarios\u2014from simple infrastructure\nmonitoring to complex automated recovery systems. For example, development\nteams use it to monitor Lambda function durations and error rates. Operations\nteams depend on it to detect high CPU usage across EC2 fleets. Security\nengineers configure alerts for suspicious activity logs, while business\nanalysts visualize application performance on dashboards for real-time\ndecision-making.\n\nGetting started with CloudWatch is straightforward. Metrics and logs\ncollection can be enabled through the AWS Console, SDKs, or command-line\ntools. Once data starts flowing, users can begin creating alarms, designing\ndashboards, and configuring log queries. Over time, teams often evolve their\nusage to include automated remediation using EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch\nEvents), which allows them to trigger predefined workflows in response to\nspecific system changes or failures.\n\n* * *\n\nIn today\u2019s always-on digital economy, proactive monitoring is no longer\noptional\u2014it\u2019s a necessity. AWS CloudWatch not only helps detect issues early\nbut also empowers teams to respond intelligently and automatically. Whether\nyou\u2019re running a high-availability web application, scaling a containerized\nplatform, or managing a global hybrid infrastructure, CloudWatch is a key\nenabler of visibility, automation, and operational resilience. Embracing it as\npart of your cloud operations toolkit is a step toward smarter, more efficient\nsystem management.\n\nAt **Simelabs** , an official **AWS Consulting Partner** , we help\norganizations harness the full potential of AWS CloudWatch and other cloud-\nnative tools. Whether you're looking to implement intelligent monitoring,\nautomate anomaly detection, or optimize your cloud infrastructure, our\ncertified AWS experts are here to guide you. Let us help you turn data into\nactionable insights and build a more resilient, high-performing digital\nenvironment.\n\n**Get in touch with Simelabs today to elevate your cloud operations.**\n\nNext  __\n\n### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/careers/machine-learning-engineer-data-scientist/", "title": "Apply For Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist | Careers at Simelabs", "description": "Apply for Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist at Simelabs, and work with some of the world's smartest people to create amazing experiences and make a difference.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist\n\nApplication\n\n  \nFirst Name\n\n  \nLast Name\n\n  \nYour Email\n\nPhone Number  \n\nHow Did You Hear About UsConferenceGoogleReferral / Word of MouthSocial\nmediaWebinarOther\n\nResume / CV  \n  \n  \n\nCover Letter  \n  \n  \n\nLast updated on June 1st, 2025,\n\n# Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist\n\n## WHAT WE\u2019RE UP TO\n\nWE ARE A LEAN, TENACIOUS MACHINE POWERED BY 85 OF THE SHARPEST, MOST\nPASSIONATE PEOPLE WE COULD FIND.\n\nSimelabs is a product-driven venture-development firm that works with a range\nof startups and big brands to create compelling, successful, award-winning\napplication.

How has Covid-19 shaped consumer behaviour?", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Evolution Of Consumer Behaviour During Covid-19\n\nThe world has witnessed the largest lockdown which caused 1.3 billion people\nto stay home. The pandemic has rapidly changed the way the consumer lives and\nworks. We are seeing a world where people are socially distancing as well as\nemotionally supporting one another.\n\n## **Amidst all these, How has COVID 19 shaped consumer behaviour?**\n\n## **Changing Behaviour**\n\nIn this span of time, people have faced a greater change in their lifestyle\nand companies are facing a greater challenge in coping up with this as well.\nIt really took some time for people including consumers and businessmen around\nthe globe to realise the situation and react accordingly.\n\nConsumers are facing new situations in life with their work from home\nschedules, new salary criteria, different leisure time and different ways of\nhaving fun. Consumers find it difficult or unwilling to go to most public\nplaces and they are more comfortable in visiting the nearby grocery and\nmedical stores. Most of the consumers are financially unstable, therefore\nforced to stay indoors during the crisis and this has caused a major attitude\nchange in what they buy and how they buy. This has dramatically changed the\nbuying course from the regular course to only essential ones. The pandemic\nstill continues with greater depression, shattering the global economy like\nnever before.\n\n## **Essentials goods and services**\n\nCrisis due to the coronavirus has triggered many companies and has prompted\nthem to lay off the employees thus reducing their income and changing their\nlifestyle. The current financial crisis continues to hit the economy and we\nare witnessing the worst global recession. During this period people care less\nabout luxury, branded or expensive goods that are not totally worth the price\nand concentrate more on the essential goods and services. The pandemic brought\nunprecedented shopping experience which has instilled many consumers to buy\nonly necessities which involve groceries and pharmacy products and currently\nthis is the mindful way to shop. In parallel to all the major consequences of\nthe pandemic, many countries are striving to attain economic recovery.\n\n## **Accelerating the eCommerce**\n\nWith the outbreak of the pandemic, there is a sudden demand for eCommerce and\nthus digital adoption in our country and most of the countries. This could be\ndue to the norms of social distancing and lockdown which are some of the\ngovernment measures, to prevent the massive spread of the pandemic, which are\ncompletely accepted by the people. Not only eCommerce, even small retail shops\nare offering home delivery and provide efficient ways to shop for groceries\nand other necessities without leaving your house. More energy and innovations\nare brought up to making a better customer experience. Once the pandemic\npasses, the people might come back to their old habits but people get to\nexperience the online services and if they feel the satisfaction and\nefficiency in the services they may continue this forever leading to a digital\ntransformation across our country.\n\n## **Why customers change brands?**\n\nBrands were once a top priority for most of the consumers but now, the crisis\ndrives people to focus on the quality, availability and price. Various\nelements of life and business are being challenged during this period and if\nthe customer doesn\u2019t get a preferred product at the preferred time then there\nis a chance where customers try a different brand.\n\n## **Focus on Health**\n\nHealth, hygiene and personal care have taken new avatars globally especially\nin India. People started purchasing a lot of health and hygiene-related\nproducts with the outbreak of coronavirus. Moreover, they also look for those\nbrands and stores which ensure safety by providing hygienic packaging and also\nhave care and attention towards the well-being of their employees.\n\n##\n\n## **Work from home**\n\nThe pandemic shows no signs of calming down and work from home is the only\noption to work in the upcoming days. Most of the employees find it more\ncomfortable and productive than before. Most of the organisations focus on\nproviding an office environment in the house which gives physical comfort to\nthe employees. The employers take high effort to make work from home possible\nefficiently and they also care about the well being of their employees.\n\n## **How does consumer spend their leisure time?**\n\nThere has been a shift from offline to online activities during the pandemic\nand hence most of the leisure time is spent online which includes\nentertainment, online education, social networking, services, messengers,\ngames, news/information and retail. People have spent a lot of time and money\non the internet and many internet services provide various offers which\nattract people and companies get major benefits from them. Most of the people\nuse the internet to work, socialise, entertain and explore the world around\nthem. The whole world is connected by the means of the internet. As work from\nhome is lifted, these pre-pandemic digital entertainments may become permanent\nnew habits.\n\n## **What\u2019s next?**\n\nThe ongoing pandemic and changing behaviour of the customers put companies at\nstake but they can revive from this loss by concentrating more on their\ncustomers and getting to know about the consumers.\n\n##  How can they do it?\n\n## **Consumer care and support**\n\nIn this time of the pandemic, people look out for additional information,\nemotional support, care and concern and also pay close attention to how\ncompanies react to all this. So companies have the opportunity to show their\ncare and concern for the customers and they, in turn, remain loyal to the\ncompany. Trust comes first in every relationship and it builds over time and\nthis is the key to consumer retention. In order to achieve trust, companies\nshould provide genuine support, financial confidence and make them feel safe\nin these difficult times and in this way companies can create real customer\nloyalty and keep them coming back.\n\n## **Get closer to c** onsumer\n\nLife during the pandemic is turning out to be the new normal and there is\nreturning back to the so-called memories of the past. People find it difficult\nto face these challenging life transitions and they are forced to stay home to\nprotect themselves from this deadly virus. Even going to the grocery store and\nthe medical store has become hard tasks. This is a perfect time for the\ncompanies to play their roles and be under the spotlight. They should show how\nthey are concerned about their consumer and there is always a purpose beyond\nprofit which involves the commitment to communities, society and the people.\nCompanies should also bring new innovations and ideas which help the consumers\ngo through the crisis securely. This could establish greater benefits in the\nfuture. Foreseeing this, many companies have already started to provide free\nsubscriptions, online services to their consumer and these companies will have\nthe opportunity to increase the adoption and save their consumer and maintain\nthe connections.\n\n## **Redefining customer experience**\n\nCompanies can provide excellent customer experience even in the time of the\npandemic. Companies should also focus on cutting down the cost without\nsacrificing the quality of the products. Companies previously depended on\nphysical meetings which are now replaced by online services. Companies offer a\nwide range of virtual capabilities or online services starting from online\nlearning class to online banking. Leading companies are making efforts to meet\ntheir customers\u2019 primary needs which involve safety, security and everyday\nconvenience. Companies are making all the physical operations touch-free,\nbringing the business to consumers house and accelerating the digital options.\nMany new applications are launched that can assist the consumers in the fight\nagainst COVID 19 as well as deal with all day to day services and these\napplications have been a surge since lockdown.\n\n## **Build life long consumer relationships to boost retention**\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Case Study | Mastering AI Object Detection & Image Processing with Python\n\nThe integration of artificial intelligence into object detection and image\nprocessing has opened up new avenues for automation and enhanced machine\ninterpretation of images and video. Among these advancements, AI-powered\nobject detection is a cornerstone in fields like healthcare, retail, and\nrobotics, where precise identification and localization of objects can drive\ninnovation and efficiency. In this blog, we\u2019ll delve into how to harness\nPython for object detection and image processing, covering foundational\nconcepts, essential tools, and a step-by-step guide to help you get started.\n\n* * *\n\n### **What is Object Detection?**\n\nObject detection goes beyond simply classifying images; it identifies the\nspecific location of objects within an image or video. Unlike traditional\nimage classification, which assigns a single label to an entire image, object\ndetection provides bounding boxes and coordinates, making it highly valuable\nin fields like autonomous vehicles, robotics, and security, where\nunderstanding an object\u2019s position and scale is essential.\n\n  * **Healthcare:** Detecting anomalies in radiology images such as MRIs and CT scans.\n  * **Retail Analytics:** Tracking customer behavior and optimizing inventory using visual data.\n  * **Robotics:** Enabling robots to identify and interact with objects autonomously.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Key Concepts in Image Processing**\n\nImage processing is the foundation of object detection, involving techniques\nthat enhance image quality or extract valuable information from visuals.\nLibraries like **OpenCV** and **Pillow** are popular in Python for handling\nimage processing tasks, including edge detection, filtering, and color\ncorrection.\n\n**Fundamental Image Processing Techniques:**\n\n  1. **Edge Detection:** Highlights the boundaries of objects in an image, aiding in object recognition.\n  2. **Filtering:** Reduces image noise, making object outlines clearer.\n  3. **Thresholding:** Converts images to binary formats, simplifying object detection.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Tools & Libraries for Object Detection in Python**\n\nPython offers several powerful libraries to handle object detection, each with\nunique strengths. Here\u2019s a look at some of the most commonly used ones:\n\n  1. **OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library):** Known for its wide range of functionalities, OpenCV can handle everything from basic image processing to complex object detection and face recognition.\n  2. **TensorFlow and Keras:** TensorFlow\u2019s Object Detection API and Keras simplify the deployment of pre-trained models like YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot Detector), and Faster R-CNN, which offer both speed and accuracy.\n  3. **Detectron2:** An open-source object detection platform developed by Facebook AI that supports state-of-the-art models, Detectron2 is highly efficient and suitable for complex scenarios.\n  4. **PyTorch and torchvision:** PyTorch is another popular deep-learning library, with torchvision providing utilities and pre-trained models for object detection.\n\n_Mastering object detection and image processing opens up a world of\nopportunities, from automating mundane tasks to making greater advancements in\nhealthcare and beyond. With Python and its vast ecosystem of libraries,\nbuilding powerful image processing solutions is more accessible than ever.\nWhether you\u2019re developing a simple app or working on advanced projects, start\nwith the fundamentals, leverage pre-trained models, and keep refining your\napproach.._\n\n* * *\n\n## How We Built an Epic AI-Powered Robotic Automation Platform for a Fortune\n500 Pharma Giant\n\nThe platform leverages advanced AI capabilities to autonomously execute tasks\nbased on high-level user commands, regardless of input format.

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Let us learn more about the key impact of digital technologies on medical devices and healthcare. Tap the link to know more.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# What Impact Will Digital Technologies Have on Medical Devices and Healthcare\nin 2022\n\nHealthcare has always been dynamic and complex, entailing provider adaptation\nto changing patient needs. This is more true now than ever as we adjust to new\npayment models, consumer-driven healthcare, and the need for greater access to\ncare \u2013 all while building on the lessons learned from the pandemic accelerated\ndigitization. As digital technology has become an integral part of the\nindustry and is poised to revolutionise medical practice, digital\ntransformation is one of the most trending topics in the healthcare industry\ntoday, particularly in digital health. From the board and the C-suite to the\nhealth IT team, doctors, and nurses, everyone is talking about how digital\ntechnologies can change the industry and lead to better care and outcomes. In\nfact, 7 percent of healthcare and pharmaceutical companies specialising in\nmedical technology said they had gone digital in a recent survey. As a result\nof the transformation, both healthcare professionals and patients have had a\nsignificantly better overall experience.\n\nThe Indian healthcare industry is about to undergo a major digital\ntransformation. While Covid-19 exposed our healthcare system's flaws and\npitfalls, technology is allowing the industry to leapfrog gaps in medical care\nand infrastructure. Around 80% of healthcare systems plan to increase their\ninvestment in digital healthcare tools over the next five years, according to\nthe Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society's (HIMSS) 2021\nFuture of Healthcare Report. According to the Healthcare Information and\nManagement Systems Society's (HIMSS) 2021 Future of Healthcare Report, over\nthe next five years, about 80% of healthcare systems plan to increase their\ninvestment in digital healthcare tools.\n\nThe key impact of digital technologies on medical devices and healthcare.\n\n  * Treating patients with the help of _Virtual Reality._\n\nPeople would have looked at you blankly if you told them ten years ago that\nyou could relieve their pain with a device that looked like a video game.\nVirtual Reality (VR) is, however, the crown jewel of healthcare's digital\ntransformation in 2022. Its numerous applications are revolutionising the way\npatients are cared for.\n\nAccording to studies, virtual reality is a safer and more effective\nalternative to drugs. Not only is virtual reality being used to treat pain,\nbut also anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and stroke. And that's just\nscratching the surface of VR's medical applications. Virtual-reality\nsimulations are also used by doctors and residents to hone their skills or\nplan complicated surgeries. Virtual reality headsets may also encourage people\nto exercise and aid children with autism in learning how to navigate the\nworld.\n\nEveryone is betting on virtual reality, from startups to pharma behemoths, and\nthere are numbers to back it up. By 2025, the global market for virtual and\naugmented reality in healthcare is expected to reach $5.1 billion. VR is a\npowerful communication channel that can help you better understand your\ncustomer's needs and virtually engage them with your products or services.\n\n  * Remote patient monitoring\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, when people were forced to adhere to movement\nrestrictions and social distancing norms, the concept of remote patient\nmonitoring (RPM) gained a lot of traction. RPM with the help of artificial\nintelligence, is slowly but steadily becoming the future of providing\nhealthcare services to patients by equipping them with a variety of medical\ndevices such as implantables, blood pressure cuffs, sensors, and other devices\nthat allow doctors to access real-time patient data for improved treatment. It\nis frequently recommended for discharged patients because it allows doctors to\nconsistently monitor their patients and act on vital data, reducing the number\nof visits to the doctor and speeding up the recovery process. It also serves\nas a way for doctors to bypass traditional healthcare settings in order to\nsave time, money, and provide high-quality care without having to see their\npatients.\n\nFor example, Navia was a part of the launch of India's first-of-its-kind smart\ndevice, which tracks how patients use metered-dose inhalers (MDI). Built-in\nsensors in the reusable device tracked daily usage and consumption patterns.\nPhysicians can use the app to track patient adherence to therapy, which can\nhelp them improve clinical outcomes.\n\n  * Telemedicine and the rise of on-demand healthcare\n\nTelehealth refers to the use of communication technology to provide healthcare\nto patients who are not in the same physical location, such as video chat via\napps or webcams, phones, or video conference software.  Prior to the pandemic,\ntelehealth services were mostly sporadic and had a wide range of limitations.\nThey were originally designed to help rural and underserved patients gain\naccess to specialists when local resources were scarce. In the years\n2020-2021, telehealth was widely used in all aspects of the industry.\n\nWhen it comes to the growth of telehealth, the greatest driving force has been\npatient demand. This demand for easy access to care services will continue,\nand providers will be held to a higher standard as a result. Patient\nexperience and expectations should be at the forefront of organisations' minds\nas they plan for the future of telehealth.  Furthermore, as demand grows, more\ncompanies are branching out and entering the market, necessitating action by\nbusinesses to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nNobody wants to have to juggle multiple apps and websites for their telehealth\nexperience to be seamless and integrated. Developers are looking for ways to\nprovide comprehensive service using integrated communications like video,\nwebchat, and bots, as well as real-time updates, reminders, and follow-up\nappointments. Furthermore, it must be streamlined for ease of use, allowing\npatients to quickly access and navigate all of their information.\n\nIn the last few decades, people have simply become far more mobile. However,\nrecent statistics show that mobile devices account for more than half of all\nweb browsing worldwide. The future of care is not only convenient and virtual-\nfirst, but it is also tailored to the needs of the customer. As a result, the\npandemic shattered long-standing barriers and accelerated digital health at a\nrate few could have predicted in just a few months. As a result, the growth of\nthe 'gig' economy, in which freelance professionals in various industries hire\nthemselves out per job or 'gig,' rather than being tethered to one company, is\ndriving on-demand healthcare.\n\nPhysicians can now provide on-demand healthcare to clients in specific\ncircumstances that match their talents, expertise, and schedule; thanks to\ncompanies like Nomad Health, an online marketplace that connects doctors\ndirectly with medical facilities for short-term work. Another benefit of\ndigital transformation in the healthcare industry is that doctors themselves\nbecome on-demand healthcare providers to better meet the changing needs of\ntheir patients.\n\n  * Secure digital prescriptions and digital health\n\nAn e-prescription, also known as an e-Rx, is a prescription that is sent to a\npatient electronically by a doctor. It is generally thought to be error-free\nand legible, as opposed to handwritten prescriptions, which have a high risk\nof errors or modifications. However, in India, e-pharmacy apps allow users to\nupload a photo of a prescription rather than the electronic version. This\npractice has raised concerns about the validity of prescriptions sent to\ne-pharmacies via mobile apps.\n\nTraditional paper prescriptions rely on the physician's individualised\nprescription pad for security (to prevent fraudulent prescriptions), and staff\nmust safeguard the blank prescriptions. After receiving the signed\nprescription, the patient must take it to a pharmacy to have it filled. Before\nreceiving the medication, the patient will have to wait an undetermined amount\nof time, depending on how busy the pharmacy is.\n\nAn electronic prescription, on the other hand, uses computer-based security\nrather than a paper prescription pad. The physician electronically \"signs\" the\nprescription, which is then immediately sent to the patient's preferred\npharmacy. One obvious benefit of electronic prescriptions is that the pharmacy\ncan begin filling the prescription while the patient is on the way, saving\ntime.\n\n  * Predictive healthcare and real-time diagnosis.\n\nThe healthcare industry is changing due to rising costs, an ageing population,\nand the prevalence of chronic conditions. Global healthcare spending is\nexpected to reach an all-time high of USD 18.3 trillion by 2030.  Payment\nmodels are already shifting from volume to outcome or value-based in response\nto these trends. Predictive analytics is assisting health organisations in\naligning themselves with these new models while also improving patient care\nand outcomes. The latest advances in big data analytics and AI are fueling new\npredictive analytics solutions that help clinicians improve outcomes and\nreduce costs, from anticipating critical conditions like septic shock and\nheart failure to preventing readmissions.\n\nConsumer demand for immediate answers continues to rise as technology becomes\nmore mobile and information becomes more readily available. This demand is\naccompanied by a rise in health-conscious consumer attitudes. Mobile apps that\nreport traffic delays, artificial intelligence software that listens to and\ninterprets commands, and wearable electronics that track activity and sleeping\npatterns are all aimed at consumers who want quick access to information they\ncan use to make daily decisions. In a world where instant, personalised\ninformation is required, diagnostic tests have virtually endless\npossibilities. Their versatility in sample collection, transport, preparation,\nand analysis makes them ideal for technology mobilisation and miniaturisation,\nas well as a wide range of applications. Diagnostic tests may move away from\ntheir traditional clinical setting and eventually be found in every home,\naffecting the way consumers make health decisions and interact with others on\na daily basis as a result of this shift toward accessible and up-to-date\nhealthcare information.\n\n### **CONCLUSION**\n\nDigital transformation of healthcare is more than just adopting new digital\ntechnology. It's all about reimagining healthcare for the digital age,\nleveraging data, artificial intelligence (AI), cloud-based platforms, and new\nbusiness models to improve health outcomes, lower costs, and improve the human\ncare experience for both patients and staff. \u201d This mindset is ushering in a\nnew era for healthcare firms and the products they create. Smart technology\nhas the potential to benefit both patients and healthcare workers. When it\ncomes to technology adoption, healthcare is a laggard, but the pandemic has\nthrown a wrench in the works, completely changing the trend. As a result, it\nis expected that the healthcare landscape will change in the future.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/leveling-up-manufacturing-how-ai-predicts-quality-cuts-waste-and-boosts-efficiency/", "title": "Leveling Up Manufacturing : How AI Predicts Quality, Cuts Waste, and Boosts Efficiency - Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Leveling Up Manufacturing : How AI Predicts Quality, Cuts Waste, and Boosts\nEfficiency\n\n**In the fast-changing world of manufacturing, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is\nproving to be a game-changer.

Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Small Data: The Unsung Hero of Business Intelligence\n\n## Discover the untapped potential of small data and how it can drive\nsignificant results for your business.\n\nIn our data-obsessed world, the spotlight often shines on the colossal, the\ncomplex \u2013 _big data_. Its promise of uncovering hidden patterns and predicting\nfuture trends is undeniable. Yet, amidst the fervor surrounding this behemoth,\na smaller, often overlooked dataset is quietly revolutionizing how businesses\noperate.\n\nSmall data, characterized by its manageability and human-centric nature, is\nemerging as a powerful tool for driving informed decisions. Unlike its larger\ncounterpart, small data focuses on specific, actionable insights that can be\nreadily understood and applied. It's the data that resides within your\norganization, waiting to be transformed into a strategic advantage.\n\nLet's explore how this unassuming dataset can be a game-changer for businesses\nof all sizes.\n\n## What is Small Data?\n\nUnlike big data, which encompasses vast, complex datasets requiring\nsophisticated tools for analysis, small data is manageable, human-\ncomprehensible information derived from specific sources within an\norganization. It's the data that's right in front of you, waiting to be\nharnessed for actionable insights.\n\nFor instance, customer feedback forms, sales figures for a particular product\nline, or social media engagement metrics are all examples of small data. While\nit may seem less glamorous than the grand promises of big data, small data\noften holds the key to solving immediate business challenges.\n\n## Wide Data: A Middle Ground\n\nTo complete the picture, it's essential to introduce the concept of wide data.\nFalling somewhere between small and big data, wide data combines diverse data\ntypes from various sources, offering a broader perspective than small data but\nwithout the overwhelming scale of big data.  \nThink of wide data as a zoomed-out view of your business, providing a more\ncomprehensive understanding of your market and customers. While it doesn't\ndelve into the granular details of small data, it offers valuable context for\ndecision-making.\n\n## The Power of Small and Wide Data\n\nBoth small and wide data offer significant benefits for businesses\n\n  * **Enhanced Decision-Making:** Small data provides specific, actionable insights that can be applied to address immediate challenges. Wide data, on the other hand, offers a broader context for making informed strategic decisions.\n  * **Cost-Effective:** Compared to big data initiatives, which often require substantial investments in technology and expertise, small and wide data are relatively inexpensive to manage.\n  * **Real-Time Insights:** Small and wide data can be processed and analyzed quickly, enabling businesses to respond to changing market conditions in real-time.\n  * **Focus on the Human Element:** Small data, in particular, emphasizes the human aspect of business, helping organizations understand customer needs and preferences on a deeper level.\n\n## Why Shift Focus to Small and Wide Data?\n\nAs businesses grapple with the increasing volume and complexity of big data,\nmany are realizing the value of smaller, more manageable datasets. Here's why\n\n  * **Personalization:** Small data allows for highly personalized customer experiences by providing insights into individual preferences and behaviors.\n  * **Agility:** Small and wide data can be analyzed and acted upon quickly, giving businesses a competitive edge in fast-paced markets.\n  * **Efficiency:** By focusing on relevant data, organizations can avoid the time and resources wasted on analyzing irrelevant information.\n  * **Human-Centric Approach:** Small data helps businesses stay grounded in the human element, ensuring that technology serves people, not the other way around.\n\n# **Small Data: Real-World Applications**\n\nLet's delve into specific examples of how small data is making a significant\nimpact across various industries\n\n### Finance\n\n**Fraud Detection:** Analyzing transaction data can identify unusual patterns\nthat may indicate fraudulent activity.\n\n**Customer Segmentation:** Identifying customer segments based on spending\nhabits and demographics can help tailor financial products and services.\n\n**Risk Assessment:** Analyzing loan application data can help assess\ncreditworthiness and identify potential risks.\n\n### Retail\n\n**Inventory Management:** Tracking sales of specific products can help\nretailers optimize stock levels, preventing overstocking or stockouts.\n\n**Customer Behavior:** Analyzing point-of-sale data can reveal buying\npatterns, preferences, and purchase frequency, enabling tailored marketing\ncampaigns and product recommendations.\n\n**Customer Feedback:** Collecting and analyzing customer feedback through\nsurveys or reviews can identify pain points and areas for improvement.\n\n### Healthcare\n\n**Patient Outcomes:** Tracking patient data such as medical history, treatment\nplans, and outcomes can help identify effective treatment protocols.\n\n**Medication Adherence:** Analyzing patient prescription refill data can help\nidentify patients who may need additional support to adhere to their\nmedication regimen.\n\n**Patient Satisfaction:** Collecting patient feedback can improve patient\nexperiences and identify areas for improvement in healthcare delivery.\n\n### Marketing\n\n**Email Marketing:** Analyzing open rates, click-through rates, and conversion\nrates for email campaigns can optimize messaging and targeting.\n\n**Social Media Engagement:** Monitoring social media metrics such as likes,\nshares, and comments can help gauge campaign effectiveness and identify\ninfluencers.\n\n**Customer Segmentation:** Analyzing customer purchase history and\ndemographics can create targeted marketing campaigns and personalized offers.\n\n### Manufacturing\n\n**Quality Control:** Tracking production data can identify defects and process\nimprovements.\n\n**Predictive Maintenance:** Analyzing equipment performance data can predict\nwhen maintenance is needed, preventing costly breakdowns.\n\n**Supply Chain Optimization:** Analyzing supplier performance data can\nidentify bottlenecks and optimize the supply chain.\n\n# **Unleash the Power of Small Data**\n\nIn a world inundated with massive datasets, small data emerges as a quiet yet\npotent force. Its ability to provide actionable insights, coupled with its\nease of management, makes it an invaluable asset for businesses seeking to\nmake informed decisions. By focusing on specific, relevant data, organizations\ncan unlock hidden opportunities, enhance customer experiences, and ultimately\ndrive growth.\n\nIt's time to shift our perspective and recognize the power of small data. By\nembracing this underutilized resource, businesses can gain a competitive edge\nand thrive in today's data-driven landscape.\n\n## **Ready to harness the potential of small data for your business?**\n\n**C** ONTACT US to explore how we can help you turn your data into actionable\ninsights.

However, manufacturers face two common\nchallenges when trying to adopt autonomous solutions: the highest value use\ncases require introducing autonomous solutions to more than one asset, line or\nfunction, and autonomous solutions leverage vast amounts of data beyond the\nreach of existing manufacturing operations management (MOM) architectures.\n\nSome manufacturers have invested in data lakes as a method for storing\nmanufacturing data, but this falls short of providing structured information\nfor optimizing end-to-end operations. Digital twins can act as a one-stop-shop\nfor autonomous solutions by gathering data from multiple sources, unifying and\ncontextualizing it.\n\nDigital twins are software models that represent the attributes and operating\nbehavior of physical assets and processes. They simulate how assets behave\ngiven certain inputs, enabling better decision-making. Digital twins support\nthe journey towards autonomous operations by involving, learning from, and\nintegrating the workforce, creating a human + machine approach to optimization\nand evolution.\n\nManufacturers can leverage digital twins without replacing their existing\nsolutions, which drives faster time to value at a lower cost. By implementing\na digital twin in parallel with the existing MOM architecture, manufacturers\ncan extract more value from years of technology investments and avoid the need\nto \u201crip and replace.\u201d Benefits can be realized within three to six months,\ndepending on use-case complexity.\n\nManufacturing execution systems (MES) continue to be an essential part of the\nmanufacturing IT stack. MES vendors are evolving their products into well-\nintegrated platforms that include quality management systems, asset\nperformance management and other features. MES vendors are also leveraging\ncloud-based solutions to accelerate deployment and extend the value of these\nplatforms. The more flexible commercial models now enable manufacturers to\npivot from large CAPEX investments to incremental OPEX expenditures that match\nthe benefits provided by projects.\n\nIn conclusion, digital twins offer a game-changing approach to manufacturing\nby simulating the behavior of physical assets and processes, allowing for\nbetter decision-making, involving and integrating the workforce, and enabling\na human + machine approach to optimization and evolution. Manufacturers can\nimplement digital twins in parallel with existing solutions, allowing them to\nextract more value from technology investments and avoid costly replacements.\nBy leveraging MES and cloud-based solutions, manufacturers can further enhance\ntheir operations and drive better results.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

There are various\nemotions connected to this process like trust, transparency, accountability,\ntimeliness, flexibility & measurability which makes it even complex to fathom\na thought process of the entire organization getting into this mode of life.\n\nThe current pandemic (COVID-19) has made us realise the vulnerability of work\nfrom home .With that said, each person has a unique remote working\nexperience.One person\u2019s energy wave can be another\u2019s distracting disaster.\n\nWe need to consider this as an opportunity to decipher better combat methods\nto overcome this situation with utmost faith.\n\n**Combat** **Technique   1 - Peace and Patience:** Master Shifu rightly said:\n\u201c Anything is possible when you have inner peace\u201d. Accept and acknowledge the\ncurrent situation. The moment that happens we remove the anxiousness that\nholds to the confusion both at work or at the home front. Thus paving the way\nto a stress-free environment.\n\n* * *\n\n**Combat Technique 2 - Fun & Communication:** Get into virtual meetings,\ndiscussion sessions, gaming or happy hours with colleagues, friends, or family\nthrough various video apps available or in person.  At the organizational\nlevel, this will both help your management and peers to achieve the goals be\nabreast with the business functions. Moreover, in your personal life, this\nwill be like making memories.\n\n* * *\n\n**Combat Technique 3 - Learning:**The entire package of work-life including\nthe commuting makes it difficult to ease out time for building yourself.\nCurrently licensed opportunity at home allows you to do all these activities.\nThis could range from educating yourself with a new skill or re-discovering\nyour hobbies like cooking, painting, reading etc. Thus making our mind agile\nwhich is a flexible mind. This will help us embrace any changes in life, good\nor bad.\n\n* * *\n\n**Combat Technique 4 - Efficiency:** This phase has made us acknowledge the\ndearth of funds, basic amenities of life, logistics etc. These play an\nimportant role in our professional and personal environment. Our coherence in\nutilizing these resources judiciously and managing with the current will\ngreatly ease our way of life.\n\nIn the words of Avengers \u201cHeroes are made by the path they choose not the\npowers they are graced with\u201d. Even if this situation is here to stay, remain\npositive and be a hero until it lasts.

Learn more!", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Indventr\n\nA mission to save lives in COVID-19 pandemic\n\n**Covid-19, the infectious disease caused by the deadly virus named\ncoronavirus is spreading at its fastest pace in India. This pandemic is an\nongoing threat to all the lives of people. While several drug trials are\nongoing, there is currently no medication proven to cure the Covid-19. Our\nmission is to save lives in covid-19 pandemic.**\n\n**In this situation, ventilators offer aid and are considered as a very\nimportant tool in the hospital to keep the patients in the critical condition\nalive. Simelabs had developed a project to provide intensive care to the\npatients by providing them with emergency care ventilators.**\n\n__\n\n## How Indventr can be helpful during the pandemic?\n\n**Indventr has been developed with a motive to solve these problems. Indventr\nhas come up with more practical solutions:**\n\n**INDVENTR-100**\n\n**INDVENTR-200**\n\n**VENTSHARE**\n\n**INDVENTR-100**| **INDVENTR-200**| **VENTSHARE**  \n---|---|---  \nBag Valve Mask based low-cost ventilator which is the standard method of\nproviding rescue ventilation to patients.| Integrated powerful blower based\nventilator which guarantees optimal performance.| A solution to avoid unwanted\nexpenses by introducing this feature which enables sharing of the ventilators\namong multiple patients  \nSophisticated design which equips a wide range of respiration rates and tidal\nvolume| Rich and well-refined design which extends the modes and enhances the\nproficiency of Indventr-100 design.| Well-thought-out design  \nIt could benefit an immense number of people based on their condition and ventilation requirements. | This can be used as a simple CPAP or BPAP device where CPAP devices can be set only to a single pressure whereas BPAP devices can be set to multiple pressures for inhalation and exhalation. It acts as an emergency care instrument which supports a wide range of modes with pressure and volume control for different medical conditions.| It ensures there is no risk as there are solutions to monitor the condition of individual patients.  \n  \n### **Ventilators are being developed for an immediate purpose to save lives\nin a COVID-19 pandemic but it could be of great use in the future also. It\ncould build an appropriate medical support system for our country so that we\nare ready to face any pandemic with full equipment.**\n\n## Building a strategy and work: How do apps play an important role?\n\n  * Technology has played a major role in changing our lives so do apps which have changed the world and indeed changing the face of healthcare.\n\n  * Indventr can be connected to mobile devices or the cloud via wifi or Bluetooth and it has used the maximal benefit of apps to enhance the project \n\n  * These applications let us control, monitor and analyze patients avoiding spot check every few hours by the nurses or doctors. \n\n  * Since Indventr provides different modes, apps are a way of switching the modes, controlling the pressure and volume of ventilation.\n\n  * Apps can help you control Respiratory Rate(RR), Tidal Volume(TV), Inspiratory: Expiratory time ratio(I/E), Inspiratory Hold which ensures ventilators are accessible for all the patients, irrespective of their ventilation requirements.\n\n  * It allows to analyze the respiration rate and if it falls down, doctors or those monitoring the patients are notified of the situation. \n\n  * With the help of data visualisation, the app provides a graphical view of the pressure, flow and volume of air that is rushed into the patients. \n\n  * Since it monitors airway pressure, it also aids to monitor the components like Peak  Inspiratory Pressure(PIP), Plateau Pressure, Peak End Expiratory Pressure(PEEP) through a mobile device \n\n  * This app is a continuous patient monitoring system. These synchronized ventilators with volume control, with advanced graphics and app-based technology which can display the values from multiple devices in the hospital, have made the Indvntr, even more, doctor and patient-friendly. \n\n## Outcomes\n\n**Simelabs is a part of Indventr whose aim is to bring up a new venture which\ncould be life-saving and beneficial for future generations. This project is an\neffort put forward by a multidisciplinary team with experience in health and\nengineering which includes robotics,IoT, Artificial Intelligence and much\nmore. The team is working hard to make the project successful in achieving the\ngoal of serving the society with an innovative, efficient and affordable\nventilation system.**\n\n### We have joined hands with Share Your Fortune to raise funds for this noble\ncause.

As they progress through their life cycles,\nthese digital copies of actual objects adapt and capture data at the same\ntime. They let organisations collect, analyse, acquire insights, and finally\nproduce the final version by first testing and developing digital versions.\n\nThis is already standard practise in the aviation, automobile, and other\nindustrial industries. However, there is a substantial distinction between a\n'digital twin' in production and a 'digital twin' in consumer shopping. While\na digital twin in the manufacturing or automation industries includes\nconducting simulations and what-if scenarios, digital twins of consumer items\nor \"things\" in retail use a different approach. Until recently, digital twins\nwere not feasible. The idea of digital twins is becoming a reality thanks to\nsecure, affordable, and widely available cloud technologies, much improved\nIoT, sensor, and data collection capabilities, and the digitization of common\nobjects like autos.\n\nThe integration of many areas of our life, such as smart gadgets, smart\ncities, and smart homes, will drive digital twins even further in the future.\n\nDigital twins in retail, unlike simulations in manufacturing, are more focused\non tracking and tracing items, making them useful for logistic businesses and\nsupply-chain managers. This data-driven digital twin information may be shared\nacross stakeholders, organisations, teams, and even nations, and it can be\ndeployed in several languages. It allows merchants and customers to keep track\nof items and the information associated with them as they are sourced,\ntransported, purchased, utilised, or consumed.\n\nDigital twins, like other forms of technology, force firms to reconsider the\nroles and responsibilities of human resources. Today's proverb is \"Technology\nwill make things possible; talent will make them happen\" - technology is a\nfacilitator, not a replacement, and a manufacturer's employees will need to\nlearn how to utilise a variety of tools and rely on a variety of abilities.\nHence, orkgroup goals/KPIs should be aligned via stakeholder analysis and\nparticipation, and with those identified, a company may better target the\ncapabilities required to achieve. Gaps can be identified using external (or\ninternal) techniques. Then devote resources to recruiting and upskilling\ncurrent employees, such as through a qualifications programme with incentives\nlinked with the company's goals. External organisations and alliances might be\nrelied upon for learning solutions or managed services, and a culture of\nconstant learning is essential.\n\nAlthough there are some changes to notice, these requirements are comparable\nfor both control towers and strategic digital twins. At the planner/scheduler\nlevel, control towers rely on a wider base of end-users, whereas strategic\ndigital twins are more precisely geared to managers, including product, supply\nchain, finance, and commercial directors. Control towers also necessitate\npeople who are more focused on root cause investigation and remediation,\nwhereas strategic digital twins facilitate executive decision-making.\n\n## **TheAR shopping learning curve**\n\nEven for habitual social media users, using social commerce is still a chore.\nFor example, if Instagram users want to try out different lipstick shades or\neyeshadows using the platform's AR-powered makeover tool, they must first go\nto a participating brand's profile or the \"Buy on Instagram\" tab of Instagram\nShopping, find a product with the feature, and then click the \"Try with the\ncamera\" button. The window of opportunity is widening as technology advances\nto allow for more immersive and integrated experiences. According to a poll\nperformed by market research firm Bizrate Insights in October 2021, half of\nthe American consumers have tried or are at least interested in utilising\naugmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) when shopping. However, the\nperfect integration of AR technology with the purchase process is still\nrequired for commercial success.\n\n## **Digital twins in the supply chain**\n\nBy replicating all assets and relationships in a complicated supply chain,\ndigital twins assist firms in addressing difficulties. It was explained in\nBCG's paper \"Conquering Complexity in Supply Chains with Digital Twins\" how a\ncorporation might use the insights to supplement decision-making across\nseveral planning horizons:\n\n  * Planning and executing short-term projects - Companies may use a digital twin to uncover execution risks early on, allowing them to mitigate rather than manage catastrophes. It allows the firm to decrease bottleneck asset idle time and enhance inventory positions.\n  * Sales and operations planning - By modeling the execution of a specific plan, emphasising risks and opportunities, and feeding the insights back into the planning process, the digital twin can improve sales and operations planning (S&OP). This enables the organisation to reduce losses caused by plan misalignment and system limits, as well as latent bottlenecks. The information also enables the organisation to better match maintenance and inventory build-ups to market demand.\n  * Longer-term planning - Understanding where the most important structural constraints are and how much extra capacity is required may help a firm enhance CapEx efficiency and optimise the entire supply chain system configuration.\n\n## Key Companies & Market Share Insights in Digital twins\n\nCompanies are investing in product R&D and process automation as a result of\nintense rivalry among major competitors to introduce improved and new goods.\nFurthermore, numerous car firms are implementing digital twin technology to\nboost consumer interaction by utilising interactive automobile dashboards on\nwebsites that allow buyers to modify automobiles at their leisure. This aids\nbusinesses in understanding consumer behaviour and modifying existing models.\n\nCompanies are producing customised goods in order to capitalise on new market\npossibilities and reach new clients. Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, for example,\nestablished a cooperation with Renault Group in December 2021. The alliance\naims to build programmes for new cars and other mobility services utilising\nDassault Systemes' 3DEXPERIENCE cloud platform. The technology would be used\nby Renault Group to manage virtual twins of its product variants. The\nfollowing are some notable participants in the worldwide digital twin market:\n\n  * ABB\n  * AVEVA Group plc\n  * Siemens.\n  * Oracle Corporation.\n  * Cisco Systems\n  * IBM Corporation\n  * SAP\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nOrganisations that are proactive and nimble will ultimately prevail. According\nto a recent LLamasoft retail research report, the most successful merchants\nare those who recognise and use technology such as digital twins, artificial\nintelligence, and machine learning early on - they are those who stay ahead of\nthe curve in difficult times. According to a Gartner estimate published in\n2019, at least half of big worldwide organisations will use AI, advanced\nanalytics, and IoT in supply chain operations by 2023. Businesses must install\nthe necessary enabling technologies to obtain insights into their supply\nchains and make them more flexible to adapt to quickly changing conditions if\nthey are to survive and prosper in the new normal.\"\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/services/artificial-intelligence/", "title": "Artificial Intelligence - Services and Solutions - Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is future of business technology and we offer many services and solutions for major industies including healthcare & education.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Artificial  \nIntelligence\n\nTake a leap into the known with analytics and AI\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly progressing from analytics dashboards\nto autonomous driving.  \n  \nWhile AI is frequently depicted in science fiction as humanoid robots, it can\nbe much more - it is powering Google's search engine, Amazon Alexa and the\nadvances in the healthcare domain.  \nML and AI are not just enhancing our ability to do things efficiently but also\nare helping us to solve challenging problems.

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Building an app have become top priority for business and the primary question that arises is whether to go for ios/android or react native platform. More!", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# React Native or iOS Native App-Which is better?\n\nMobile applications have become a top priority for all major companies. When\nyou decide to build an app for your business, the primary question that arises\nis whether to go for ios/android or react native platform. To know which one\nis the best, we make a comparison between the ios and react native which\nincludes their strength and weakness and thus helps you in making a better\ndecision.\n\nIn this digital era across the world, mobile apps are ruling the technological\nworld due to its various benefits. Mobile apps render an excellent platform\nfor business, education, banking, reading, social networking and many more.\n\nAccording to Statistics, Android and iOS are the most popular mobile platforms\nout there, with Android taking 74% of the mobile OS market share as of 2019.\n\nIn the midst of this, if you are someone who is confused about making a choice\nbetween native app development and React Native app development, this article\nis going to be a good read for you.\n\n### How is React Native different?\n\n### Why is it becoming more popular?\n\n### What are the benefits?\n\n### Are there any downsides?\n\n### Is the React-Native best solution for your business?\n\n## What is React Native Development?\n\nReact Native is a sophisticated framework by Facebook. It allows easy and\nsmooth development of iOS and Android applications simultaneously using\nJavascript programming language. It provides great UX/UI design in both\nplatforms and it is also cost-effective to be developed.\n\n## How React Native differs from Native development?\n\nThe idea behind React Native is a framework that will cover all the platforms\nand this was a dream that has been in the industry for years and seemed\nimpossible to accomplish. Native apps utilize different programming languages\nfor each platform but React Native is based on JavaScript. Sharing of code\nbetween various platforms including Android, iOS and web apps is granted to\nreact-native users. It allows sharing 70% of the code between the apps, thus\nreducing development time in cross-platform mobile app development.\n\n## Pros of React Native\n\n### Single codebase:\n\nThe best advantage of mobile app development with React Native is that it\nprovides developers with an opportunity to write a single codebase that can\nrun on both Android and iOS platforms.\n\n### Time-Saving:\n\nBecause of the single codebase, it saves a lot of time as well as human\nresources for the development of the apps. It can boost productivity\nsignificantly, reduce development efforts, speed up the development processes\nand hence app will hit the market sooner.\n\n### Hot-Reloading:\n\nHot reloading is a feature supported by React Native where the developers can\nview all the changes made by them in real-time on the screen.\n\n### Reliable:\n\nReact Native, being an open-source application has an ad vantage of inspecting\nthe code and is found to be compatible with other platforms. Besides being an\nopen-source framework it also allows to add extra features efficiently.\n\n### Native performance:\n\nWith React Native you can be sure that it will perform at an almost native-\nlike level as these applications render their user interface using native\nAPIs.\n\n## Cons of React Native\n\n### Native Elements:\n\nReact native does not grant the usage of all the native elements of a device\nlike a camera, GPS, voice recorder.\n\n### Native code:\n\nReact native can be used for developing simple and efficient applications that\ndo not have multiple complex features. Native codes are required in those\ncases where you have to build a demanding and well-functioning mobile app.\n\n### Third-party features:\n\nReact Native Development is lagging behind Native development as there is an\nabsence of third-party libraries. Moreover, to make use of the native\nlibraries, the incorporation would have to be made in native modules which\nraises the development efforts.\n\n## What is iOS Native Development?\n\niOS Native mobile app development involves building apps for particular mobile\noperating systems(iOS) by using programming languages like Objective-C or\nswift. Users can access the iOS apps from the App Store.\n\n## Pros of iOS Native\n\n  * It brings great user experience and platform for implementing sophisticated UI/UX design and animation.\n\n  * Native apps are more secure and it guarantees users reliable data protection\n\n  * Native apps maintain fast operating speed, smooth work and high performance as they are developed for a specific operating system.\n\n  * The native app equips the facility to integrate with hardware devices like camera, GPS, audio devices.\n\n  * The native apps can be launched in the app store with ease\n\n  * The native apps are more interactive, intuitive and provide users with a sophisticated experience\n\n## Cons of iOS Native\n\n  * Native iOS projects are considerably more expensive when compared to cross-platform web applications.\n\n  * Cost of updating and maintenance are also higher.\n\n  * It requires high development time and effort.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nReact Native and iOS Native seem to have advantages and disadvantages in equal\nproportions. Hence it is very challenging to decide which one is better and\neverything depends on which project you are working on. React native is the\nbetter option when the project is simple with basic features but its always\nbetter to choose iOS native if the project consists of complex\nfunctionalities.  \nSome projects demand a specific platform like iOS and are expecting to adopt\nplatform-specific features and in that case, it's better not to choose React-\nnative. React native is used on those projects which recommend cross-platform\ndevelopment and some of them include Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Walmart,\nSkype, Uber Eats. It can boost the speed of development and can reach more\nusers.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/tag/ehr/", "title": "EHR Archives - Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# EHR\n\n##  CareHQ : Remote Patient Monitoring Solution\n\nMay 19, 2023 3:16 pm\n\nTimely Patient management and alerts to avoid critical mistakes.

A public key is a wallet address in\nthe form of a cryptographic code, which can be shared to receive\ncryptocurrency. A private key is very confidential to you as it is used to\nauthorize any transaction through your wallet.\n\nThere are 3 types of crypto wallets:\n\n  1. Exchange based software wallets \u2014 wallets inbuilt within a centralized exchange like Vauld and CoinDCX.\n  2. Hardware wallets \u2014 access crypto holdings only by connecting USB to a computer physically. eg: Ledger, Trezor\n  3. Browser based software wallets \u2014 which we can control, install on our system and keep the private key. They are the gateway to the world of Web3.0 and NFTs. eg: Metamask, Coinbase and Trust wallets\n\nimage credit: Finextra Research\n\n### **Dapps**\n\nDapps stand for Decentralized applications.

Mempool size depends on\nthe blockchain and its activity. Larger the mempool size, the higher the\nnetwork use and the longer the wait time.\n\nimage credit: Science Direct\n\n### **Metadata**\n\nMetadata is essentially the information about data. Metadata of an NFT is\nsimply the attributes of an NFT like name, description, and image.\n\nNFT Metadata\n\n### **Minting**\n\nMinting is the process of placing an NFT into the blockchain for the first\ntime. Minting is bounded by a transaction fee.\n\nimage credit: The Motley Fool\n\n### **Moralis**\n\nMoralis provides the easiest and simplest way of connecting to cross-chains.\nIt is a software or a middleware which helps us to build cross-chain dapps\nquickly.

It has a greater effect on the lives and\nlivelihoods of people who are trying to cope with the new normal. This global\npandemic is a forewarning from the nature and a reminder that we have been\nfacing pandemics like this for years and will be facing in our near future.\nThis article provides insights on how the organisations and people are\naffected by this pandemic and how they are dealing with it.**\n\n## **Economic Crisis**\n\nThe pandemic has led us to an ambiguous position where we are completely\nuncertain about various matters like the global economic outlook for the\ncoming years, how long the pandemic will last and answers to most of the\nbusiness-related issues but we would like to share some information regarding\nthe impact of Covid-19 on business and the economic dislocation we are facing\nright now. The pandemic has affected the business sector ferociously affecting\nthe supply of basic raw materials, halting the business trips and spoiling the\nproduct values causing a high risk on the product, leading to economic\nuncertainty and loss for the organisation. It has brought many new hurdles and\nhas changed many of the existing plans and has changed the workforce\nmanagement during this crisis, which the team was not prepared for. As\nbusiness activities during Covid-19 are slowing down, revenue and cash flow\nreduce putting the economic condition of the organisations at stake. But the\noption to stay uncertain and not act accordingly is never a good option. It\u2019s\npossible to uplift the productivity but what about the consumption. It always\ndepends on the consumers and there is a need to understand the behaviour of\nconsumers during the COVID 19. There are changing trends among the consumers\nand to know more about this please visit our blog-**Consumer Behaviour During\nCOVID-19.**\n\n According to the world bank, this is going to be the worst recession that has\nhit the world until now since the second world war. Most of the countries\nwhose revenue largely depended on tourism, trade, exports are the ones worst\naffected. The economic condition of the country depends on the number of\npeople affected and the severity of the pandemic in that country and hence it\nvaries from region to region.\n\n## How technology sector varies from other sectors?\n\nIn this situation, we have understood the importance and relevance of\ntechnology and how it has become part of our life in a very less span of time.\nMany businesses started instilling technology to deal with the pandemic. The\ntechnological sector being a broad and versatile sector is not affected the\nsame way as other sectors. It has better options to work from anywhere which\noffers employees to work from home without affecting the productivity of the\norganisation in any manner. Working from home seems like the most viable\noption to hold on to the business during Covid-19 without putting the life of\ntheir employees in danger. Employees are settled in remote areas and the\ncompany should ensure that they have enough facilities to work under\nconditions and should ensure the security of the data being handled by the\nemployees.\n\nIf the organisations try to understand the new consumer behaviour or trend\nduring the pandemic along with the ease of handling their employees, they\ncould sustain the recession by staying in the market as the situation demands\nthe dependency on technology. Since most of the countries are locked down due\nto the pandemic, the people have started spending more time online than\noffline. Everything is available online and people find it more comfortable\nstaying home in this situation and avoid the risk due to the pandemic.\nEntertainments also play a very important role as it keeps the society and\npeople from turning off during this lockdown. When the modern pandemic locked\nbillions of people inside the home, gaming and streaming services like\nNetflix, amazon prime has gained a lot of popularity and subscribers leading\nthose companies to success and make greater profits. This is indeed an\nexcellent opportunity for most of the organisations to evolve as digital\ntransformation is becoming a necessity or requirement among the public.\nTechnology sectors which involve digital technologies, gaming, eCommerce,\ncommunication tools are having disguised benefits during this lockdown and\nthese sectors are really booming. The demand for social media platforms and\nconferencing tools like meet, zoom, hangouts, Whatsapp, the duo are increasing\nto stay in touch with the families, to attend the meetings, conferences and\nwork simultaneously.\n\nThere is also a high demand for the industries which are related to\nhealthcare. Healthcare technology is moulding the future of healthcare as\nsituations like this might arise in the future and its better to be prepared\nthan before. Technology is the most effective weapon during the pandemic to\nexamine and control the outbreak. People are consulting doctors online for\nmedical supervisions and medical assistance to avoid risk in visiting\nhospitals. Most of the hospitals demand more ventilators and other pieces of\nequipment due to the increasing cases of COVID-19. So the companies should try\nto evolve along with changing trend and the pandemic conditions. Simelabs has\nintroduced a project named Indventr to provide innovative, efficient and\nemergency care ventilators to all COVID patients at a very low cost. This was\nstarted with a mission to be a helping hand and save millions of lives,\nespecially in Covid-19 pandemic. To know more about this, visit\nhere-**Indventr**\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**With experiences from the past, Organisations are trying their best to face\nthe situations, survive the economic crisis of the pandemic so that they could\nthrive successfully in the future.

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Learn how conversational designs bridge the gap between humans and artificial intelligence through technology.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Exploring Conversational Design for chatbots.\n\n**Introduction to Conversational Design**\n\nWhen it comes to conversational design in technology, it's critical to grasp\nsome of the foundations of conversation design, which is becoming increasingly\npopular. Sure, we could discuss sophisticated psychological ideas that can be\nused in conversational interface design, but for now, we'll stick to the\nfundamentals. It's critical that we all start applying these concepts\ncorrectly so that those billions of people may at least have a positive and\nhuman-centric experience. Humans and AI must learn to interact with one\nanother if they are to live and work together. Conversation designers can help\nwith this by building trust between humans and artificial intelligence. When\nyou consider all of the technological advancements in the industry today, you\ncan see that conversation design is going to be a big task in the future,\nespecially with the Internet of Things (IoT) on the horizon.\n\n**What is conversational design?**\n\nA design language based on human communication is known as conversation design\n(similar to how material design is a design language based on pen and paper).\nThe more a user interface relies on human speech, the less it needs to be\ntaught to them. Voice user interface design, interaction design, graphic\ndesign, motion design, audio design, and UX authoring are all part of it.\n\nA conversation designer's job is similar to that of an architect in that they\nplan out what users can accomplish in a place while taking into account both\nthe user's wants and technology limits. They organise the discourse by\noutlining the flow and underlying logic in a thorough design specification\nthat encompasses the whole user experience. To iterate on the designs and\nbring the experience to life, they collaborate with stakeholders and\ndevelopers.\n\n## **3 Pillars of a Conversational Design**\n\nBefore we start writing our first dialogue, let's look at three broad concepts\nthat separate good discussions and dialogues.\n\n\u200d\n\n### **Psychology of a conversation: The Cooperative Principle**\n\nPaul Grice was a British philosopher of language whose work had a significant\nimpact on the study of semantics. To define how individuals connect with one\nanother, he proposed the Cooperative Principle. He expressed the following\nprinciple:\n\n_\u201cMake your contribution such as it is required, at the stage at which it\noccurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you\nare engaged\u201d._  \n\nThe concept is named after the fact that listeners and speakers must work\ntogether and mutually accept one another in order to be understood in a\ncertain way. It is not intended as a command, but rather as a description of\npeople's regular conversational behaviour. It effectively lays forth the core\nidea that what we say in talks advances the conversation's goals.\n\n### **Turn-Taking**\n\nIn most cases, discussions require at least two individuals who contribute\nequally \u2013 linguistically known as turn-taking. We don't worry about giving\nover the speaking position in natural interactions. After queries, speaking\npauses, or filler words, we nearly always take over.\n\nHowever, we must use this very deliberately while building the conversation in\norder to place the user in the role of the speaker. Typically, the person can\nonly offer one response before the machine takes control. This type of\ndialogue assistance \u2013 brief responses from the user followed by an\ninterpretation and response from the digital assistant \u2013 is especially\ndifficult if the user was interrupted too soon or delivered a message\nimproperly. Correction alternatives and \"going back\" must be considered in\nadvance when designing a discussion.\n\n\u200d\n\n### **Context**\n\nWe now know exactly what the user said even when using voice input, owing to\nAdvanced Speech Recognition. However, deciphering what it signifies remains\ndifficult. This interpretation is especially problematic since the\nconversation's relative context must be considered.\n\nIt's difficult since the same words might have various meanings in different\nsituations. The term \"tape\" can refer to recording equipment, packing\nmaterial, or the process of recording or gluing things together, for example.\nThe setting is critical.\n\nDue to the obvious popularity of talking among consumers, companies and\nmarketers feel that communication is the greatest way to capture and captivate\nour ever-fleeting attention. They were not mistaken. The experience economy\nhas created a need for more customised encounters and emotional connections\nwith businesses, and the conversational approach has begun to win over\ncustomers all over the world. However, not just the meaning of words, but also\nthe meaning of complete utterances, is context-sensitive, that is, reliant on\nthe user's surroundings or circumstance. This is why, in conversational\ndesign, it's critical to construct conversations and logic processes that are\nas near to the user's reality as feasible.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIf you believe that implementing a conversational chatbot for your company is\na massive effort, you are correct. Yes, it is.\n\nChatbots are still one of the most popular use cases for Cx Designers, as the\nchat medium has shown to be a reliable tool for organisations to generate more\nleads and save support expenses by automating customer success and sales\ndialogues. Due to the obvious popularity of talking among consumers, companies\nand marketers feel that communication is the greatest way to capture and\ncaptivate our ever-fleeting attention. They were not mistaken. The experience\neconomy has created a need for more customised encounters and emotional\nconnections with businesses, and the conversational approach has begun to win\nover customers all over the world.\n\nAllow our Professional Services team to serve as your experienced guide to\nconversational design and assist you in reaching the pinnacle of\nconversational chatbots.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

It focuses on automating routine tasks, predicting potential system\nfailures, and streamlining incident management. This automation results in\nfaster decision-making and reduced downtime while minimizing human\nintervention for routine tasks.\n\nAI Ops draws from multiple data sources, including logs, event data,\nperformance metrics, and user behavior, to make real-time decisions. By\nanalyzing this vast pool of data, AI Ops tools can detect anomalies, forecast\nissues, and even provide remediation recommendations before a human is aware\nthat an issue exists.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Key Components of AI Ops**\n\nTo fully understand the transformative potential of AI Ops, it's important to\nexplore its key components, each of which works synergistically to improve IT\noperations.\n\n### **1\\. Data Collection and Analysis**\n\nThe foundation of AI Ops lies in its ability to ingest and analyze massive\nvolumes of data from multiple IT environments. AI Ops tools continuously\ncollect data from various sources like servers, cloud services, databases,\napplication performance logs, and network devices. This data provides the raw\nmaterial for AI-powered insights. The real magic happens when AI Ops systems\nanalyze this data, identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies that human\noperators would struggle to catch manually. By correlating data across\ndifferent systems, AI Ops can flag root causes of issues rather than just\nhighlighting surface-level symptoms.\n\n### **2\\. Machine Learning Algorithms**\n\nMachine learning is at the heart of AI Ops. Over time, machine learning models\ntrain on historical data, learning to predict when and where system failures\nor performance degradation may occur. These algorithms evolve as they process\nnew data, becoming more accurate in identifying causes of system downtime,\nperformance bottlenecks, and security vulnerabilities. In addition, machine\nlearning can enable AI Ops tools to recommend the optimal configuration of\nresources, ensuring that IT environments are operating at peak efficiency. For\nexample, an AI Ops system can allocate more resources during periods of high\ndemand or alert IT staff when critical infrastructure is under strain,\nminimizing the risk of outages.\n\n### **3\\. Automation**\n\nOne of the most valuable benefits of AI Ops is its ability to automate\nrepetitive and time-consuming tasks. This includes infrastructure\nprovisioning, configuration management, and even basic incident resolution.\nAutomation relieves IT teams from manual processes, allowing them to focus on\nhigher-priority initiatives, such as strategic planning and innovation. For\ninstance, AI Ops can automatically detect a system fault, initiate a fix, and\nverify the outcome\u2014all without human intervention. This not only saves time\nbut also ensures faster remediation, reducing downtime and maintaining\nbusiness continuity.\n\n### **4\\. Intelligent Alerting**\n\nTraditional monitoring systems often overwhelm IT teams with a flood of\nalerts\u2014many of which are false positives or low-priority issues. AI Ops solves\nthis problem by implementing intelligent alerting. AI-powered systems\nprioritize alerts based on severity and potential business impact, ensuring\nthat IT teams are only notified about issues that require immediate attention.\nThis cuts down on alert fatigue and ensures that critical incidents are\naddressed promptly. By analyzing historical data and context, AI Ops can also\nsuppress redundant alerts and cluster related incidents together, enabling a\nmore efficient response process.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Benefits of AI Ops**\n\nThe adoption of AI Ops provides numerous advantages to IT operations, and\nbusinesses stand to gain in multiple areas:\n\nBy automating routine and repetitive tasks, AI Ops drastically cuts down the\nmanual effort needed for IT operations, freeing up teams to focus on high-\nvalue work and boosting overall productivity. Its predictive capabilities\nenable IT teams to proactively address potential issues before they become\nmajor problems, enhancing system reliability and reducing downtime.\nAdditionally, AI Ops optimizes resource allocation and automation, preventing\nover-provisioning and reducing operational costs. By minimizing downtime,\norganizations can avoid the expensive consequences of unplanned outages and\nservice interruptions, leading to significant cost savings.\n\n**Faster Incident Response**  \nTraditional IT operations often involve manual troubleshooting, which can be\ntime-consuming and prone to error. With AI Ops, incidents can be detected and\nresolved in real time, allowing IT teams to respond faster. This results in\nshorter resolution times, reducing the business impact of outages and service\ndegradation.\n\n**Proactive Maintenance**  \nAI Ops allows for proactive maintenance by predicting potential system\nfailures and enabling preventive measures. This approach reduces the risk of\nunplanned outages, increases equipment lifespan, and saves organizations from\nthe costs associated with emergency repairs or unexpected downtime.\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Future of IT Operations is Here and It 's Smarter Than Ever**\n\nAI Ops represents a significant leap forward in the way IT operations are\nmanaged, offering a proactive, data-driven approach that can adapt to the\ndemands of modern digital infrastructures. By leveraging AI and machine\nlearning to automate tasks, optimize performance, and predict potential\nissues, AI Ops enables IT teams to deliver faster, more reliable, and more\ncost-efficient services.\n\nAs AI and machine learning technologies continue to evolve, AI Ops will only\nbecome more powerful and essential in helping businesses navigate the\ncomplexities of digital transformation. Organizations that adopt AI Ops early\nwill be well-positioned to stay competitive, enhance their operational\nefficiency, and better meet their customers\u2019 needs in the fast-paced digital\nworld.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/industries/manufacturing/", "title": "Manufacturing - Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Manufacturing\n\n**Improve efficiency through resilient supply chains, insightful production\nlines,modernized cloud technologies and organizational structures.**\n\n## How we help businesses succeed\n\n__\n\n#### Smart Manufacturing Technology\n\nWe leverage advanced technologies, including hybrid cloud, automation,\nsensors, computer vision, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), to empower\ncompanies to enhance their efficiency and productivity.

Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing\nservices over the internet, such as IT infrastructure, storage, network\nsystems, and applications. A third-party vendor is in charge of managing and\nmaintaining the physical data centres where cloud services are hosted. It's\ncritical to keep up with the latest developments as cloud technologies advance\nand more businesses adopt cloud-based services. Cloud computing technologies\nprovide a vital underlying structure that will support the majority of the\nworld's economy through 2020, enabling the industry's largest ecosystem of\nremote workers to date. As the ripple effects of the pandemic are likely to\nreverberate throughout 2022 as well, it is wise to take a closer look at how\nthe cloud has progressed in 2021, as well as delve into the trends we can see\ntaking place in 2022.\n\n**Edge Networking**\n\nAs traditional on-premise IT infrastructure vendors like IBM, HP, and Dell\nlook to provide models and solutions with seamless cloud integration but lower\nlatency and increased security, edge networking is likely to gain traction.\nFurthermore, as 5G is deployed and IoT is adopted in manufacturing and\nindustry, low latency devices and solutions at the edge will continue to scale\nexponentially as faster, more dynamic, and more responsive applications are\ndeployed to leverage the technology.\n\nSASE (secure access service edge) services, which combine software-defined WAN\ncapabilities with cloud-native security services like zero trust access and\nfirewalls as a service, may benefit from this. Edge computing is, therefore,\nan excellent choice for time-sensitive data in areas where connectivity is\nlimited. It's expected that as 2022 will progress a greater emphasis on edge\nsecurity will emerge as organisations look to protect data and applications\nacross this distributed approach.  The last mile of distribution will be a key\nchallenge and enabled by security services at the edge. Hence, it's safe to\nsay that we can expect a lot of activity in the cloud-to-edge space.\n\n**Automated Programmable Infrastructure**  \n\nInfrastructure is becoming increasingly software-defined and programmable.\nProgrammability, combined with AI and machine learning, will automate many of\nthe tasks that operations support currently performs manually. As a result,\nthe Cloud's real secret is its ability to automate. Automation, when done\ncorrectly, can boost your delivery team's efficiency, improve the quality of\nyour systems and networks, and reduce the risk of slow systems or downtime.\nHowever, there is a catch: automation is difficult. As the investment in\ncitizen developer tools and AI grows, expect to see more devices released.\nCloud vendors will be able to automate much more easily as a result of this.\n\n**Cloud Ubiquity**\n\n This trend appears to have already materialised. Backups and data continuity\nis more straightforward. The cloud has resulted in cost savings from Capex to\nOpex. IT staffing requirements are reduced. The cloud allows you to scale up\nand down your usage as needed. Cloud security has been shown to outperform on-\npremise security in studies. The cloud appears to be a 'no-brainer' for a\nvariety of reasons.\n\n**The Internet of Things (IoT)**\n\n The growth of IoT and everything that follows, including smart cities, is one\nof the most significant cloud computing trends. Utilities, parking meters, and\ntraffic lights are already connected to IoT networks in some American cities.\nIoT refers to the tens of billions of smart devices that can be given an IP\naddress, such as smartwatches that display news on your wrist, lightbulbs that\nturn on automatically when connected to a phone, and more.\n\n#### **Cloud Security  **\n\nSecurity remains one of the most common barriers to cloud adoption, fueling\ninvestments in improving this aspect of the cloud. According to Gartner, at\nleast 95 percent of security-related cloud failures will be caused by a\ncustomer, not a flaw in the system, by the end of 2022. Most architectures,\napproaches, and processes are now geared toward security as security becomes a\ncritical component within cloud environments, with DevSecOps being a great\nexample of that shift.  \n\n### **Virtual Cloud Desktops**\n\nWith working from home becoming the \"new normal,\" we've seen an explosion of\ncollaboration tools, video conferencing apps (Friday Zoom drinks anyone? ),\nvirtual whiteboards, and increased use of project management tools we've\nalways used.\n\nThe virtual desktop is an often-overlooked but increasingly popular cloud-\nbased service. With the ability to provide up-to-date synchronised technology,\nshared licensing, and pay-as-you-go subscriptions, the adoption of offerings\nlike Google Chromebook, Windows Virtual Desktop, and Amazon Workspaces is\navailable and likely to gain popularity in 2021.\n\n**Sustainability  **\n\nEvery responsible business recognises that it has a role to play in addressing\nclimate change's challenges. In the tech world, this usually entails lowering\nthe energy costs of providing customers with 24/7 \"always-on\" infrastructure\nservices, as well as lowering the energy usage associated with increasingly\npowerful computing engines, larger digital storage requirements, and the\nenergy costs of providing customers with 24/7 \"always-on\" infrastructure\nservices. The majority of tech behemoths will spend 2022 implementing measures\nand innovations to help them meet their net-zero carbon targets. Amazon, the\nworld's largest cloud company, is also the world's largest buyer of renewable\nenergy, with 206 of its own sustainable energy projects in operation around\nthe world, generating about 8.5 gigawatts per year.

Metadata of an NFT is\nsimply the attributes of an NFT like name, description, image and other\nproperties.\n\nIn OpenSea Marketplace, where we can trade our NFTs, we could find different\ntypes of NFT metadata as follows:\n\n  1. Editable\n  2. Frozen\n  3. Centralized\n\n### **Editable Metadata**\n\nWhen we directly create our NFT on OpenSea without any custom smart contracts\n(via lazy minting), such NFT metadata will be treated as Editable and its\ncreator can update its properties later.\n\nCreate your NFT on OpenSea directly as follows:\n\nAfter creating the NFT, you can verify the metadata type as Editable.\n\nEditable Metadata\n\n### **Frozen Metadata**\n\nFrozen metadata refers to metadata that is stored in a decentralized storage\nplatform. In OpenSea, when we freeze our metadata, it is get stored in a\ndecentralized file system which then can be used by other users as well. We\nhave to pay a gas fee to freeze the metadata. Such metadata is secured and\nhence can\u2019t be taken down by a single user. Once it is frozen, its metadata\ncan\u2019t be edited further.\n\n_How to freeze metadata on OpenSea?_\n\n  1. First, you need to create your NFT on OpenSea.\n  2. Go to edit your NFT where you could find an option to freeze the metadata as follows:\n\nFreeze Metadata on OpenSea\n\n3. After clicking on freeze, you will get a prompt to confirm complete freezing as below:\n\nConfirm Freeze on OpenSea\n\nAfter freezing metadata, you can verify the metadata type as **Frozen.**\n\nFrozen Metadata\n\n### **Centralized Metadata**\n\nWhen we create an NFT via OpenSea UI (via lazy minting), the metadata will be\nEditable first. With the first purchase or transfer of that NFT, the metadata\nwill get hosted on OpenSea\u2019s server and it will become centralized and hence\nits creator will not be able to edit its properties.\n\nFor example, when we transferred the NFT from the creator\u2019s wallet to some\nother wallet, the metadata type becomes Centralized.\n\nCentralized Metadata\n\nNext  __\n\n### Verify Smart Contract on Polygonscan\u2014 using Hardhat\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Lets learn more about digital twin and simulation. Tap the link to know more.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Digital twin vs Simulation\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0, which connects everything\ndigital, are terms we're all increasingly acquainted with. However, the\ndigital twin, the new kid on the block, has failed to gain traction.\n\nThe amazing thing about technology is how quickly it evolves. Over the last\nfew decades, the scene has changed dramatically, with innovative technology\nbecoming commonplace in ever-shorter timeframes. Many people believe that the\ndigital twin will follow suit - in fact, that it is the only natural step\nforward for technology. In the simplest sense, a digital twin is a computer\nrepresentation of the actual world. To put it another way, it's a virtual\nrepresentation of a physical thing, or set of objects, or system. Furthermore,\nthe digital version (the twin) is updated in real-time to guarantee that the\ntwo are almost identical. Since the beginning of the century, the idea has\nbeen around. However, it has only been in the last several years that the\ntechnology required to completely implement the notion has been available. It\ncollects data using a variety of sensors and components. After then, a digital\ncounterpart \u2013 or 'twin' \u2013 is created. The level of detail in the cyber version\nwill be determined by the quality and depth of the data utilised.\n\n### **Simulation**\n\nIndustry uses simulations to test goods, systems, processes, and concepts.\nSimulations are digital models created with computer-aided design software\ntools and are frequently utilised throughout the design phase. These models\ncan depict aspects of a process or product in 2D or 3D, but they can also be\nbuilt using mathematical principles rather than computer-based\nrepresentations. The simulation evaluates results by introducing and testing\nvarious factors into the digital environment or interface. In most situations,\nsimulations are utilised for design and, in certain circumstances, offline\noptimization. On the other hand, digital twins are employed in real-time\nthroughout the complete design-execute-change-decommission lifecycle. At best,\nsimulations can aid in understanding what might occur in the actual world.\nDigital twins can help you grasp not just what could happen, but also what is\noccurring right now (how the design is behaving in the real-world).\n\n### **Pros and Cons**\n\nCompared to CAD-based simulations, digital twins provide a more adaptable and\nin-depth simulation procedure. These benefits include the ability to collect\nactual real-time data on an asset's ongoing performance throughout its\nexistence. A digital twin is also not dependant on a designer's capacity to\nthink of and then test all possible factors, allowing the designer to focus on\nfixing any real problems and making improvements.\n\nA digital twin may also be used to inform larger business choices, and its\nbreadth is only limited by the data that is given. Furthermore, digital twins\ncan transmit data between multiple systems via the Internet of Things to offer\na fuller picture of performance or for comparative reasons.\n\nFor monitoring important items such as wind turbines, the advantages of\ndigital twin over a more basic, non-integrated CAD-based simulation are\nobvious. Digital twins, on the other hand, might be pricey due to the need for\nsensors and their connection with analytical software and a user interface. As\na result, digital twins are often used only for the most vital assets or\noperations, where the expense is justified.\n\n### **Digital twin and Industry 4.0**\n\nThe fourth industrial revolution, often known as Industry 4.0, is a buzzword\nin the business world. It encompasses automation, data interchange, and\nmanufacturing technology. Digital Twins are at the heart of this new\nindustrial revolution, opening up a world of possibilities previously\nunimaginable. It replaces the old industrial strategy of \"first construct,\nthen modify\" with a virtual system-based design process that extracts a far\nmore efficient function from any equipment or system by comprehending its\nunique characteristics, performance, and possible concerns, if any. An\noperator can be educated on a virtual machine using Digital Twin instead of\npaying for a specialist trainer or simulator.With the advancement of Machine\nLearning and Artificial Intelligence, the robots will be able to take autonomy\nto the next level in the not-too-distant future. The function of the Digital\nTwin will evolve in such an autonomous world of industrial machines, and we\nmay expect robots to become more self-aware. With minimum interaction from a\nmanual operator, such machines will be capable of optimising their\nperformance, coordinating with other machines, performing self-diagnosis, and\nself-repairing any flaws that may arise. Without a question, the world of\nmanufacturing and engineering has a bright future ahead of it, and Digital\nTwins are an important step in that direction.\n\nWhereas simulations can help you comprehend what might happen in the real\nworld, digital twins let you compare and evaluate what might happen with what\nis currently happening.\n\nThis real-time perspective is given in a clear 3D format, making it simple to\nmonitor and comprehend project status, equipment, production lines, and even\nhospital patients. This integrated approach of delivering real-time data can\nhelp prevent bad decisions, aid in preventative maintenance, and decrease\naccidents and costly downtime. Processes or assets that are digitally\ntransformed can assist improve product design, improve troubleshooting, and\ngenerate new ideas. This is based on the data's quality, which is where'smart'\ngadgets and technology come in, allowing for a secure two-way data flow. This\ntrove of information reveals fresh methods to improve the actual world,\nwhether it's through goods, procedures, or human-machine interactions.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Below are some key\nareas where AI is making a difference in frontend development:\n\n  * **Code Completion** : Tools like GitHub Copilot and TabNine suggest code snippets as you type, making coding faster and more efficient.\n  * **Responsive Design** : AI can automatically adjust the layout of a website for different screen sizes, ensuring that the user experience is seamless across devices.\n  * **Debugging & Error Detection**: AI algorithms can quickly identify and flag errors in code, making debugging more efficient.\n  * **Personalization** : AI enables more dynamic and personalized user interfaces by analyzing user behavior and preferences, ensuring an enhanced user experience.\n\n## **How to Integrate AI Into Your Frontend Workflow**\n\nIntegrating AI tools into your development process can significantly\nstreamline your workflow. Here\u2019s how you can get started and make the most of\nAI in your frontend development process.\n\n### **Identify a Task AI Can Improve**\n\nThe first step is to pinpoint tasks within your frontend development process\nthat AI can enhance. Common areas include repetitive code writing, design\nadjustments, or testing. AI can also assist with accessibility enhancements by\nanalyzing design and code to ensure compliance with standards such as contrast\nratios or keyboard navigation. Moreover, AI tools can provide valuable UI/UX\nrecommendations based on user interaction data, helping to create more\nengaging interfaces. Localization is another area where AI shines, automating\ncontent translation and adapting designs to different languages and regions.\n\n### **Research AI Companies with Relevant APIs**\n\nOnce you\u2019ve identified tasks that could benefit from AI, it\u2019s time to research\nAI tools and services that fit your needs. Popular options include GitHub\nCopilot for real-time code suggestions, TabNine for AI-powered code\ncompletion, and Figma Plugins for automating design tasks. There are also\ntools like Framer, which automatically converts designs into code, and Zeplin,\nwhich assists with design handoffs to ensure front-end implementation\naccuracy. As you explore these options, ensure the AI tools align with your\ntechnology stack to ensure seamless integration.\n\n### **Understand the AI Tool\u2019s Learning Curve**\n\nSome AI tools require a learning period where they adapt to your coding style\nor project specifics. Be sure to allow sufficient time for the AI model to\nlearn and optimize its suggestions. Initially, you may need to provide more\nmanual input as the AI fine-tunes its understanding of your workflow. However,\nas it learns, the tool will become increasingly efficient and aligned with\nyour specific development needs.\n\n### **Integrate the AI Service**\n\nMost AI tools provide APIs that simplify the integration process. By following\nthe documentation provided by the service, you can integrate the AI seamlessly\ninto your code editor, design tool, or development environment. Additionally,\nyou can automate workflow tasks using tools like GitHub Actions or CI/CD\npipelines, triggering AI-driven processes like testing or design validation\nduring the build phase. It\u2019s important to ensure cross-tool integration, where\nmultiple AI services can work together, maximizing their effectiveness in your\ndevelopment process.\n\n### **Test and Refine the Integration**\n\nOnce the AI service is integrated, thorough testing is crucial to ensure\nsmooth functionality. The integration should be refined and tailored to suit\nyour specific workflow and project requirements. Using A/B testing can help\nyou compare AI-generated outputs with traditional methods, allowing you to\nassess the real impact of the AI on your development process. It\u2019s equally\nimportant to track AI-generated changes using version control systems like\nGit, so you can review and approve the changes before implementing them.\n\n### **Ensure Ethical AI Use**\n\nWhen integrating AI, it\u2019s essential to ensure the ethical use of these tools.\nMany AI solutions rely on external services, so it's crucial to ensure they\ncomply with data privacy laws such as GDPR or CCPA. Additionally, AI tools can\ninadvertently introduce bias into your code or design, so it's important to\nmonitor their output to ensure it is fair and inclusive. This vigilance helps\nmaintain user trust and ensures that your application meets ethical standards.\n\n### **Leverage AI for Continuous Learning**\n\nAI is not a static tool; it thrives on continuous learning and improvement.\nImplement feedback loops that allow the AI to evolve with your application.\nFor example, AI can analyze user interactions over time, enabling you to\nrefine your app\u2019s UI/UX based on real-time data. Similarly, as the AI gets\naccustomed to your coding patterns, it can offer more relevant and accurate\ncode suggestions, making your codebase cleaner and more efficient.\n\n### **Monitor AI Performance Metrics**\n\nAs with any tool, monitoring AI\u2019s performance is essential to ensuring that it\nenhances, rather than hinders, your workflow. Track processing times to avoid\ndelays in your development environment, and monitor the AI tool\u2019s resource\nusage to prevent excessive consumption of CPU or memory. This ensures that the\nAI tool runs smoothly and efficiently, without introducing lag into your\ndevelopment pipeline.\n\n### **Regularly Update AI Tools**\n\nAI technology is rapidly evolving, and keeping your AI tools up-to-date is\nessential for maintaining their efficiency, security, and feature set. Regular\nupdates often introduce new functionalities, security patches, and performance\nimprovements. Staying current with the latest versions will allow you to take\nfull advantage of the advancements in AI-powered development tools. Reviewing\nrelease notes can also help you discover new features that may further\nstreamline your workflow.\n\n## **Tips for Optimizing AI-Enhanced Frontend Development**\n\nWhile AI tools can greatly improve your workflow, there are important\npractices to follow to ensure optimal performance and security.\n\n**1\\. Use Lazy Loading and Caching for Faster Load Times:** Lazy loading helps\nreduce initial page load time by loading only essential content first and\ndeferring non-essential elements. Combining this with caching ensures that\nyour web application runs efficiently, even as it becomes more AI-powered.\n\n**2\\. Implement Secure API Endpoints and Authentication:** As AI tools often\nrely on external services, make sure to secure your API endpoints and use\nproper authentication to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n**3\\. Monitor Performance Regularly:** AI can optimize many aspects of\ndevelopment, but its performance needs to be continually monitored. Make sure\nyour AI tools are running smoothly and adjust as needed to avoid lags or\nerrors in production.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nAI is undeniably a game-changer in frontend development, automating repetitive\ntasks and allowing developers to focus on the bigger picture. Whether you're\nlooking to improve code completion, optimize design, or create more\npersonalized user experiences, AI offers a wealth of tools to enhance your\nworkflow.\n\nBy identifying areas for AI integration, selecting the right tools, and\noptimizing your implementation, you can leverage AI to boost productivity,\nstreamline development, and create more sophisticated applications.

The pandemic has launched an unprecedented and formidable\nchallenge to the whole world drastically affecting the economies and\ncommunities likewise.\n\nIn the face of these challenges, returning to normal will not be the same as\nbefore. Even though every day passes with the uncertainty of what we are going\nto face tomorrow, our actions today can be a mark of resilience and strength\nin the fight against the major pandemic and will future the days ahead.\n\nOrganizations all around the world are coming together and taking steps to\ncombat the spread of Covid-19 and trying to prepare for the new normal. Well\nmost of them have different approaches and I would like to share our approach\nand response towards the pandemic.\n\nOur early approach by adopting efficient and effective practices and focussing\non building strategies have helped us to keep our employees safe and protect\nour clients and thus become more resilient and thrive in business in these\ndifficult times.\n\n## Simelabs\u2019 response to Covid-19\n\n### How has Work From Home helped?\n\n  *   * \n\nWe prioritized the safety of the employees over anything and Work From Home\nwas the first step we took in the initial days of the covid-19 pandemic. Work\nfrom Home was not something new for us but this indeed was the first time on\nsuch a large scale. Everything including scrums, meetings, daily tasks,\nfollow-ups was done and managed in homes which ensured a flexible and most\ncomfortable working atmosphere for our employees and saviour for all\nbusinesses as it could have forced us to shut down. The implications of the\nemployees are also much more in terms of productivity, training and overall\nwell being.\n\n### Is work from home possible for all employees?\n\n  *   * \n\n75% of our employees stay and work from home but some projects demand the\npresence of employees in the office as they require more team effort and\nphysical presence. We have been ensured the employees a safe workplace with\nclean personal workspace, sanitizers, hand washing procedures followed by\nsocial distancing. For those employees who find it difficult to work from home\nand still prefer the office as their workplace, effective measures are ensured\nin the office to provide them with a safe place to work.\n\n### How is Simelabs keeping its employees safe?\n\n  *   * \n\nSimelabs has embraced the policy of Work from home for most of the employees.\nThose employees were given the instructions and protocols to be followed while\nworking from home to avoid extreme fatigue and to avoid the situation they may\nget left behind in work. We provide employees with extensive measures to make\nthem aware of the current situation and keep them safe.\n\n### How did we create a safe working place for employees?\n\n  *   * \n\nWe have introduced new guidelines and revised procedures that should be\nfollowed by all employees for safety and security. Various risk management\nmeasures are followed which include social distancing to slow down the spread\nof infection by ensuring less contact between people. We also make sure every\nemployee wears a mask. Handwashing facilities with clean running water, soap,\npaper towels or air dryers and hand sanitiser facilities in locations such as\nworkspaces, office entrances/exits to encourage hand hygiene are also\nprovided. In addition to all this, the office is cleaned routinely instead of\nregularly.\n\n### How has Simelabs dealt with this pandemic?\n\nOur decision-making skills which involve taking the right decision on the\nbehalf of the organisation at the right time helped us to preserve the\ncontinuity in business as well as empower the resilience across our\norganisation. We follow the protocols provided by the World Health\nOrganisation, keep tabs on the current situation which includes the government\norders and directives and thus work accordingly. We have established few\nimmediate steps which involved establishing remote working options, reducing\nthe meetings and travel, providing flexibility for the employees, prioritizing\nthe safety of people, establishing good communication with customers, shifting\nthe strategies to an online platform and maintaining hygiene in every aspect\nof the business.  \n\n### What is Simelabs business continuity plan?\n\nMost companies experience lots of interruptions during this pandemic which may\nhave put their business in stake with heavy losses. We have faced many\nchallenges including the shift in the consumer demand which have helped us to\npave the way for new projects like Indventr. We did negotiate with the new\nterms and conditions which include financial stability and have brought the\nbest creative ideas into action. We have brought many effective measures for\nour employees including work from home, safety at our office, flexible working\noptions which have led to more productivity. While the pressure in the house\neases off, we also monitor and communicate with our clients to instil\nconfidence in them. Simelabs have always operated with transparency with open\ncommunication with employees and clients which have been greatly appreciated\nin times of the pandemic.\n\n### How Simelabs manage clients?\n\n  *   * \n\nSimelabs has taken several steps to ensure the client services are not\ninterrupted.

Mint an NFT based on the deployed smart contract_**\n\n _Now let\u2019s see how we can transfer the NFT from one wallet address to\nanother!_\n\n## Step 1: Get some fake MATIC\n\nAs blockchain transactions are bound to gas fees, we need to collect some fake\nMATIC to transfer the NFT.\n\nGet some fake MATIC from here: https://faucet.polygon.technology/\n\nOther MATIC faucets available:\n\n  1. https://faucet.pearzap.com/\n  2. https://matic.supply/\n  3. https://www.coinclarified.com/tools/faucets/polygon\n  4. https://faucet.firebird.finance/  \n  \n\n## Step 2: Create .env file\n\n    \n    \n    API_URL = \u201cRPC Node URL\"\n    PRIVATE_KEY = \"sendor's metamask private key\"\n    PUBLIC_KEY = \"sendor's metamask wallet address\"\n    CONTRACT_ADDRESS = \"deployed contract address\"\n    USER_ADDRESS = \"recipient's wallet address\"\n\n## Step 3: Create nft-trasnfer.js file\n\nCopy the following content to the file.\n\n_tokenId  _specifies the NFT token to transfer which you will get once you\nmint an NFT.\n\n_safeTransferFrom_  is an overloaded function. In ethers.js, the syntax to\ncall an overloaded function is different from a non-overloaded function. You\ncan refer to it at here.\n\n    \n    \n    const { ethers } = require(\"ethers\");\n    const contract = require(\"../artifacts/contracts/ArGram.sol/ArGram.json\");\n    const {\n       API_URL,\n       PRIVATE_KEY,\n       PUBLIC_KEY,\n       CONTRACT_ADDRESS,\n       USER_ADDRESS\n    } = process.env;\n    const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(API_URL);\n    const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, provider);\n    //Get gas price\n    const gasPrice = await provider.getGasPrice();\n    //Grab contract ABI and create an instance\n    const nftContract = new ethers.Contract(\n       CONTRACT_ADDRESS,\n       contract.abi,\n       wallet\n    );\n    //Estimate gas limit\n    const gasLimit = await nftContract.estimateGas[\"safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)\"](PUBLIC_KEY, USER_ADDRESS, tokenId, { gasPrice });\n    //Call the safetransfer method\n    const transaction = await nftContract[\"safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)\"](PUBLIC_KEY, USER_ADDRESS, tokenId, { gasLimit });\n    //Wait for the transaction to complete\n    await transaction.wait();\n    console.log(\"Transaction Hash: \", transaction.hash);\n\nYou will get a response like below:\n\n    \n    \n    Transaction Hash: 0xfcfaf0afb6ed3b38ab7583d90a8fd9b10cb0c17c1218c0668c94c33482283c5f\n\nYou can verify the transaction on Mumbai polygonscan.\n\nTransaction on Polygon Mumbai\n\nGreat!

Search less and Find more!", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# GoShop\n\nMastering the shopping experience of every customer\n\n### Find the best places for shopping with our mall finder!\n\nSimelabs have partnered with a Dubai based startup to reimagine the shopping\nexperience in regions like the Middle east. Together we helped to develop a\nnew mall finder application which serves to explore the best malls to shop in\nthe city. This has set a vision to be the first digital mall finder which\nwould be necessary to ensure the attraction and retention of the increasing\npublic that includes shopaholic customers of all ages.\n\n**With more than 100 malls in the middle east, a Dubai based startup\nenvisioned to bring digital experience in locating the right mall of your need\nby developing apps for androids and ios. They partnered with Simelabs to bring\nthe magic of shopping on our fingertips.**\n\n## Building a strategy: Apps run the business\n\nOver these years mobile phones have transformed itself from being a\ncommunication tool to an effective business tool. As technology is advancing\nat lightning speed, people are becoming more addicted to these devices and\nthey play a very important role in their lives. With time, the importance of\nmobile applications in business has climbed the ladder to the top. Mobile apps\nhave made the life of customers easiest. Every information is available on\ntheir fingertips and thus keep you connected with everything. In order to\nfulfil the demands of people, all business ventures prefer apps over anything\nas they provide great business exposure.\n\n## Simplified Shopping Experience with the best mall finder\n\nThe world today seems to run on applications. While mobile commerce is\nbecoming the new norm, several customers are relying on mobile apps to make\ntheir purchase. Only less than 33 per cent of people prefer to shop online and\n90 per cent of customers purchase in stores at least once a month as they\nwould like to see the items in person. Most customers use several apps to find\nthe sale details, to redeem coupons and to find the services provided by a\nparticular mall. But what if every single need could be fulfilled by a single\napp.\n\nIn a region like the middle east, where there is a mall at every nook and\ncorner, it is very challenging to find the mall of your preference. Every\nsingle person has specific reasons to go to a mall and the person might be\nlooking for a mall nearby or maybe looking for the best bargains in the\nmarket. GoShop app helps to tackle this difficult circumstance. With the\nintelligent mall finder, it offers a simple way to view all the malls nearby\nand hence navigates to your favoured one.\n\nEnables seamless shopping experience over 85 malls across Dubai, Abu Dhabi,\nSharjah, Ajman Fujairah, Al Ain, Ras al Khaimah and Doha.\n\n## An app with everything you need for a mall finder\n\n### Explore:\n\nThis application acts as a guide in every mall, where customers are notified\nof the promotions, sales, offers in all your favourite shops. It also allows\nyou to bookmark your favourite shops and get updated frequently on every sale.\n\n### Guide:\n\nThis application acts as a guide in every mall, where customers are notified\nof the promotions, sales, offers in all your favourite shops. It also allows\nyou to bookmark your favourite shops and get updated frequently on every sale.\n\n### Navigation:\n\nA mall can always confuse people with massive floors and plenty of shops and\nit is very difficult to locate the shop you are looking for. This application\nhelps to navigate through the mall with ease.\n\n### Events:\n\nA shopping mall can also host several events like movie premieres, promotions,\nproduct launches and this app lets you know about these events so that you\ndon't miss it.\n\n### Customer interaction:\n\nThis application provides a platform where people can check-in at any mall and\nshare their experience in the form of photos, rates, reviews, experiences.\n\n## Outcomes:\n\nAs a result of this collaboration, the client has made great success in\nrefining their platform so they are able to provide their customer with a\nbeautifully designed, easy to use and flexible mobile solution for shopping. A\nnumber of users are spending their time on these apps which leads to higher\nrevenue and customer loyalty. Ultimately, app users are able to find what they\nare looking for and thus app was able to connect with the people.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\nNext  __\n\n### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

This shift reflects a broader movement towards patient-\ncentered care, aiming to make healthcare more accessible, efficient, and\ntailored to individual needs. By leveraging advanced technology, these models\nare redefining traditional care practices, offering new solutions to age-old\nchallenges such as hospital overcrowding, high costs, and patient discomfort.\nAt the heart of this transformation is RPM, a technology-driven approach that\nallows for continuous, real-time monitoring of patients outside conventional\nclinical settings. This blog explores how RPM, in conjunction with the\nHospital-at-Home model, is reshaping healthcare delivery, enhancing patient\noutcomes, and improving operational efficiency. From addressing the urgent\nneeds highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic to providing personalized care\nfor chronic conditions, RPM is poised to revolutionize how we think about and\ndeliver healthcare.\n\n## **Assessing the Shortcomings of Traditional Healthcare Delivery**\n\n  * **Accessibility Barriers**  \nTraditional hospital-based care often presents significant hurdles for\npatients, particularly those residing in rural or underserved areas.\nGeographical distances, limited transportation options, and a scarcity of\nhealthcare providers in these regions can collectively create substantial\nbarriers to accessing essential medical services. Consequently, individuals in\nthese communities may experience delayed or inadequate care, leading to\nworsened health outcomes.  \n\n  * **Economic Burden**  \nHospitalization can impose a considerable financial strain on patients and\nhealthcare systems alike. The costs associated with inpatient care, including\nmedical procedures, medications, and extended stays, can be exorbitant. For\nmany individuals, these expenses can lead to financial hardship, bankruptcy,\nor even deferral of necessary medical treatments. Moreover, the overall cost\nof healthcare is inflated by the reliance on hospital-based care, placing\nimmense pressure on healthcare budgets.  \n\n  * **Compromised Patient Experience**  \nHospitalization can be a disruptive and stressful experience for patients. The\nunfamiliar environment, separation from loved ones, and potential exposure to\ninfections can negatively impact a patient's physical and emotional well-\nbeing. Additionally, hospital stays often involve inconvenience, such as\nrestricted diets, limited mobility, and dependence on others for daily tasks.\nThese factors can diminish a patient's quality of life and hinder their\nrecovery process.\n\n## **Tech is Your New Nurse: How Gadgets Track Your Health**\n\nThe critical role of RPM became particularly evident during the COVID-19\npandemic. Oxygen levels, a vital health metric, were intensely monitored due\nto the surge in patients requiring respiratory support. The shortage of\nhospital beds and oxygen cylinders highlighted the need for continuous, real-\ntime monitoring of essential parameters. Advanced RPM systems are now making\nthis vision a reality.\n\nRPM involves a range of technology-driven devices that capture physiological\nparameters and transmit them to healthcare platforms in real-time. This\ntechnology functions outside of traditional clinical settings, providing\nongoing monitoring and immediate data transmission. Common applications of RPM\ninclude:\n\n  * **Blood Glucose Monitoring** : Essential for managing diabetes, RPM devices track blood glucose levels and alert patients and providers to potential issues.\n  * **Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Tracking** : RPM systems monitor cardiovascular health, enabling timely interventions for conditions such as hypertension and heart disease.\n  * **Pulse Rate, Body Temperature, and Oxygen Levels** : These metrics are crucial for assessing overall health and detecting potential emergencies.\n  * **Respiratory Rates and Surveillance** : RPM tracks breathing patterns and supports monitoring for mental health conditions or disabilities.\n  * **Substance Abuse Rehabilitation** : RPM aids in tracking recovery progress and adherence to treatment plans.\n\n## **Reach of Remote Patient Monitoring**\n\nRemote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems are sophisticated digital health\nsolutions that employ a systematic approach to improving patient care. This\napproach is underpinned by five fundamental processes. The first step is data\ngathering. This involves the collection of health data from patients using a\nvariety of devices, such as wearable sensors, blood pressure monitors, and\nsmart scales. These devices continuously or intermittently capture vital\nsigns, biometric data, and other relevant health metrics. The collected data\nis then transmitted to a secure healthcare platform, a process known as data\ntransmission.\n\nTo ensure patient privacy and data integrity, shielding this information from\nunauthorized access is paramount. Robust security measures, including\nencryption and access controls, are implemented to protect sensitive health\ndata. The next crucial step involves analyzing the collected data using\nadvanced algorithms and machine learning techniques. This process uncovers\npatterns, trends, and anomalies that can provide valuable insights into a\npatient's health status. By identifying potential health risks or\ndeteriorating conditions early on, healthcare providers can proactively act to\nimplement necessary interventions. These interventions may include medication\nadjustments, lifestyle modifications, or scheduling follow-up appointments.\nRPM systems have the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery by\nenabling continuous monitoring, early detection of health issues, and improved\npatient outcomes. By empowering patients to take an active role in their\nhealth management and providing healthcare providers with real-time data, RPM\nsystems are transforming the way care is delivered.\n\n### **Additional Considerations**\n\n  * **Patient Engagement:** Effective RPM programs require active patient participation. Education and support are essential for ensuring patient adherence to monitoring protocols.\n  * **Data Interoperability:** The ability to seamlessly exchange and integrate data from different RPM devices and healthcare systems is crucial for comprehensive patient care.\n  * **Regulatory Compliance:** RPM systems must adhere to strict data privacy and security regulations to protect patient information.\n  * **Clinical Integration:** Successful implementation of RPM requires close collaboration between healthcare providers, patients, and technology experts.\n  * **Cost-Effectiveness:** Demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of RPM programs is essential for widespread adoption.\n\n## **RPM: It 's a Game-Changer**\n\nRPM offers numerous advantages that extend beyond traditional care models\n\n  * **Chill at Home, Stay Healthy:** RPM lets you kick it at home and still get top-notch care. No more hospital drama or long commutes.\n  * **Early Alert System:** Think of RPM as your health's personal alarm. It spots red flags before they become a major issue, saving you from stressing out.\n  * **Own Your Health:** RPM puts you in control. Check your health stats, track your progress, and be your own health boss.\n  * **Less Stress for Docs:** With RPM, doctors get a heads up on your health. This means less paperwork and more time for chill vibes.\n  * **Chronic Illnesses? No Prob:** Managing diabetes, heart stuff, or breathing issues? RPM is your new BFF, helping you stay on top of things.\n  * **Bounce Back Faster:** Recovering from surgery or an illness? RPM helps you heal quicker and stronger, so you can get back to your life.\n\n## **Case Summary : Transforming Healthcare with****CareHQ****: The Future of\nRemote Care**\n\nIn the rapidly advancing realm of healthcare, Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)\nhas proven to be a pivotal innovation, enhancing the connection between\npatients and healthcare providers.

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "New venture in the education sector. Attend online exam in the comfort of home or space you like. Online proctoring system. Discover more here!", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Xzeds Arjuna\n\nOnline proctoring to advance your learning and testing program\n\n## Introduction\n\nOver the years with the advent of digital media and technology, teaching\nmethods and teacher-student interactions have advanced globally. Today, the\neducation sector is not just bound to classrooms but is connected to the\ninternet and hence becomes highly accessible and serving the industry.\nSimelabs along with Xzeds has introduced a new venture in education where\nstudents are given the facility to attend online exam from anywhere and that\ntoo without cheating.\n\n## The Story: The new trend of online exam\n\nThe education sector has evolved through decades and as it becomes more\ncompetitive, digital transformation is becoming a necessary means of survival.\nThis forces the education sector to adopt and adapt to new digital\ntechnologies. This sector is the last industry which holds on to the\nantiquated practises and methods but now, they realise there is a need for\ntechnology in education. Schools and teachers are now making significant\nchanges in the classrooms, in the way instructions are given and the way they\ninteract with students.\n\nGone are those days where education is bounded to the classroom, information\nis limited to textbooks, and teachers using blackboards to students writing\ncopy notes. Now we have reached a state where classes are becoming digital,\nwhere teachers provide you with animation videos, where information is never\nlimited to a book but to a number of digital textbooks available through the\ninternet, where you can enrol to any courses at any time anywhere.\n\nEven in this transforming phase of education where everything is becoming\ndigital, the way of attending exams always remains the same. We need to go\neither to specific examination centres or to Prometric centres to attend the\nexams where every examination centre is provided with invigilators, who are\nappointed by the examination board to conduct the exam according to the rules\nand regulations of the board. It is always a problem when you don't find an\nexamination centre or Prometric centre nearby and this is the time to change\nthe traditional way of attending exams.\n\nWhat we need is a system where you can attend online exam in the comfort of\nhome or any space you like. Xzeds helps you to achieve this by providing an\nonline proctoring system. Every single person will have either a smartphone,\ntab or laptop and with the help of these devices, students can attend exams\nfrom places of their convenience. With the help of the application developed,\neducation board can now ensure that the students are not cheating.\n\n## Attending online exam anytime anywhere but how?\n\nExamination centres and Prometric centres have either invigilators or CCTV\ncameras at every corner of the room to ensure that students are not cheating.\nBut its really a challenge, in the case, where students are attending online\nexam in laptops, smartphones, tabs which have only a single camera. How do we\nensure the person is not cheating? How do we ensure the right person is\nattending the exam? In order to face this challenge, Xzeds have brought up 3\nlevels of analysis.\n\nFirstly, the application verifies the user id and password which was given to\nthe person before the online exam.\n\nSecondly, the person has to display the identity card which he has been\nprovided during registration.\n\nFinally, the application takes the live photo of the person while registering\nand verifies the same person is attending exam by taking the live photo at\nthat time and this verification continues throughout the examination where\nphotos are taken at random intervals.\n\nThis also checks adequate lighting is there in the room for the recognition to\ngive a proper response. Since this is an Artificial Intelligence module, it\ntolerates up to some level of changes where you can change the hairstyle or\nput on specs.\n\nNow comes the main part where it does online proctoring without the help of an\ninvigilator. How is it really possible? The application captures the live\nphotos of the person every few seconds and checks for details from these\nframes. It captures every expression on your face, head movements, eye\nmovements, hand movements and even your gestures. It also monitors the\npresence of other devices on the screen like smartphones, headphones, books,\nsunglasses. It randomly checks whether there is more than one person on the\nframe and also detects whether there is a presence of other voices in the\nframe. It observes every frame delicately and in the moments of aberration as\nspecified above, the frame is flagged and sent to the examination board so\nthat they can look into the matter, hence making the task of examination board\nmuch easier.\n\n## Outcomes\n\nXzeds and Simelabs have efficiently built an application that could probably\nchange the education sector in a sophisticated way. It could thus turn the\nantiquated exam traditions to a highly digitized one which makes the task of\nboth invigilators and people easier. It is already in its budding state and\nhence will prove its efficiency once it blooms.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\nNext  __\n\n### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About - Simelabs\n\n#### Our Clients\n\nThis is us\n\nBack\n\n### Services\n\nInnovative Solutions For Today's Business Challenges\n\nView all our services\n\n#### Data Engineering and Data Science\n\n#### Technology & Engineering\n\n#### Robotics\n\nView all our services\n\nBack\n\n### Career\n\nWanted: Innovators, Thinkers, Doers\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\n#### DevOps/MLops Engineer (AI/ML Focus)\n\n#### Cyber Threat Prevention Analyst (Endpoint Security Engineer)\n\n#### Clinical Biostatistician\n\nCareers at Simelabs\n\nBack\n\n### Work\n\nWhat We've Done and How We've Done It\n\nView all our work\n\n#### Prime Healthcare Modernization\n\n#### Traffic Sign Design\n\n#### Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nView all our work\n\nBack\n\n### Insights\n\nOur industry experts are driving the conversation in the digital field.Here\u2019s\nwhat they are saying.\n\nView all our insights\n\n#### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\n#### Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\n#### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nView all our insights\n\nBack\n\n### Industries\n\n  * About\n  * Services\n  * Career\n  * Work\n  * Insights\n  * Industries\n\n    * Resources\n    * Videos\n    * Privacy\n    * Contact Us\n\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n\nTop\n\n", "type": "Document"}, {"id": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://www.simelabs.com/tag/technology-engineering/", "title": "Technology Engineering Archives - Sinergia Media Labs", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Technology Engineering\n\n##  Traffic Sign Design\n\nJune 1, 2023 5:38 am\n\nSimplify Engineering Drawings and Printable Signage Creation The 3M\nTransportation Safety division is actively working\n\n##  Corob Analytics Dashboards\n\nMay 31, 2023 6:38 am\n\nNext-Gen Analytics Dashboard for COROB: Empowering Businesses with Data-driven\nInsights and Enhanced Sales As a\n\n##  CareHQ : Remote Patient Monitoring Solution\n\nMay 19, 2023 3:16 pm\n\nTimely Patient management and alerts to avoid critical mistakes.

When you have to move from a source to destination,  this app gives you\nthe best option at that particular time to reach your destination in the\neasiest and most efficient manner.\n\n## A transport app that keeps you moving\n\nWith transit options at your fingertips, you can connect and track the\ntransits, share your journey with your friends and even figure out the\nschedules.\n\n### **Find Your Transit**\n\n**You can find your bus by entering the source and destination. This app\nprovides all in-depth information about your transit including the routes,\nstops, facilities, directions with live guidance, how long you are travelling,\nwhen will you reach the destination and how many stops are left. Go through\nall your options and you can select the best from them with a single finger\nstroke.**\n\n### **Analysis of schedule**\n\n**The hyper-commute has made inquiring the timetable seamless.

Tap the link to know more.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# What is Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT), and how does it work?\n\n**Introduction**\n\nBefore diving in-depth into Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) let us see how\nit came about. Throughout the last few decades, robots and robotic systems\nhave brought significant changes to numerous socioeconomic areas of human\ncivilization. Product assembly, automobile painting, box packaging, and shield\nwelding are all examples of sectors where industrial robot manipulators are\ncommonly utilised to execute repetitive, monotonous, crucial, and/or dangerous\nactivities. Due to their excellent accuracy, precision, durability, and speed,\nthese preprogrammed robots have always been particularly effective in a\nvariety of structured industrial applications. Robotic technologies were\nintegrated with existing network technologies to widen the range of functional\nvalues of these robots when deployed in unstructured scenarios during the\ndevelopment of networked robotics in the 1990s.\n\nThe restrictions have prompted academics to consider \"Cloud Robotics,\" a new\ntype of efficient robotic system. Cloud robotics can be defined as a system\nthat uses the \"Cloud Computing\" infrastructure to access massive amounts of\nprocessing power and data in order to run [5]. That is, unlike networked\nrobots, all sensing, processing, and memory are not integrated into a single\nindependent system. When a network connection is unavailable or unstable\n(i.e., offline), cloud robotic systems sometimes contain some of their\ncapacity for local processing for low-latency replies.\n\n**Definition**\n\nAcademics Francois-Xavier Dudek and L.D. Fauvet invented the term \"Internet of\nRobots\" (IoRT) in a study published in the Journal on Autonomous and Adaptive\nSystems in 2009. The Internet of Robotic Things is a concept in which\nintelligent devices may monitor events, combine sensor data from many sources,\napply intelligence to identify the best course of action, and move physical\nitems. The key distinction between IoT and IoRT is that, in addition to\nsharing data and communicating, IoRT devices may also move around in the real\nworld and interact with existing items. It's also a global information society\ninfrastructure that enables advanced robotic services by interconnecting\nrobotic things based on existing and evolving interoperable information and\ncommunication technologies, where cloud computing, cloud storage, and other\nexisting Internet technologies are centred on the benefits of converged cloud\ninfrastructure and shared services that allow robots to benefit from powerful\ncomputational capabilities.\n\n**IoRT and Possible Implementations**\n\nRobotics and the Internet of Things are widely used across the supply chain.\nIoRT is used in maintenance, for example, where robots can identify and solve\nissues in existing systems on their own. Mass production can also benefit from\nautomated manufacturing technologies. Furthermore, e-commerce provides\nsufficient room for IoRT implementation, allowing robots to locate, pack,\nlabel, and ship things after they have been ordered on a website.\n\nAnother field where IoRT may be used in healthcare. Humans can use intelligent\nrobots to assist with patient care, monitoring, and even surgery.\n\nConsumers nowadays are also hoping to have personal robots in their homes\nsoon. Other smart gadgets and automated systems can benefit from the\nincorporation of robots. Cleaning the house or walking the dogs can improve\ncomfort and convenience.\n\nFinally, security and surveillance are two areas where robots might be\nbeneficial. In crisis management, where personnel is in danger, robots would\nbe an appropriate answer. They can also deliver goods and give assistance to\nvictims.\n\n**The versatility of IoRT :**\n\nIndustries have begun to blend this technology with their machinery in order\nto get better outputs with fewer faults. Not only can this technology be used\nfor automation, but it can also be used with artificial intelligence, Digital\nTwins, Distributed Ledger, VR/AR, and many other technologies. This broadens\nthe scope of what IoRT can accomplish.\n\n### **Suitable Existing Robots for IoRT Architecture**\n\nIn general, there are two types of robotics: Service robotics and Field\nrobotics. Humanoid and domestic robots that perform human-oriented support\njobs are referred to as Service Robotics. Domestic jobs, office work, personal\nmobility assistants, room cleaning, and deliveries are all examples. Field\nRobotics, on the other hand, defines robots that operate in unstructured and\nuncontrolled situations, often outdoors. Aerial, Marine, and Ground robots are\nthe three subcategories of field robots. These robots can operate in a broad\nrange of operational and environmental settings.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) and robotic systems are closely working, changing\ntheir relationships, and managing to produce new-generation products with the\nonset of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The backbone of the so-called\nIndustry 4.0 is disruptive technologies like this. The Internet of Robotic\nThings is a concept that combines robotic agents and IoT to create new\npossibilities in both industrial and research fields, including manufacturing,\nagriculture, health, surveillance, and education. The state-of-the-art of IoRT\napplications is detailed in this publication, with an emphasis on the key open\ndifficulties of integrating robotic technology into smart settings and their\ninfluence on numerous academic disciplines. The impact of IoRT technology and\napplications in everyday life is also highlighted, highlighting the necessity\nfor greater research into remote and automated applications.\n\nNext  __\n\n### How AWS CloudWatch Simplifies Monitoring and Detects Anomalies Fast\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

These dynamic platforms\naggregate vast amounts of data from diverse sources, transforming raw\ninformation into meaningful insights. By presenting key performance indicators\n(KPIs) in a clear and visually appealing manner, dashboards enable\norganizations to make data-driven decisions that drive growth, efficiency, and\nprofitability.\n\nDashboards serve as a central hub for monitoring business performance across\nvarious departments, from sales and marketing to finance and operations. They\nprovide a holistic view of the organization's health, allowing stakeholders to\nidentify trends, patterns, and anomalies that may impact business outcomes.\nThrough interactive features and customizable visualizations, dashboards\nempower users to explore data in depth, uncovering hidden opportunities and\naddressing potential challenges.\n\n## **What is a Data-Driven Analytics Dashboard?**\n\nA data-driven analytics dashboard is a dynamic interface that presents\ncritical data points in an easily understandable format.

The innovative system, with a Prana-developed solution called\niSAVE, won validity recently, as per a publication in top weekly magazine\n_Science Translational Medicine_.\n\nThe three-firm consortium has completed functional prototypes of their designs\nfor BVM-based emergency resuscitator INDVENTR-100 besides INDVENTR-200, a\nfeature-rich pneumatic design that addresses an affordable range of cost and\ncapability points.\n\n\u201cINDVENTR-100 is priced low. As an ambu bag-based respirator, it offers\nmultiple ventilation schemes,\u201d says Sinergia CEO Derrick Sebastian, revealing\nthat the device, which works on mandatory as well as spontaneous modes, is\nbased on a design by MIT of America.\n\nOn the other hand, INVENTR-200 goes by a pneumatic blower-based design. It is\nrich in features, he adds.\n\nSilji Abraham, an advisor of the IndVentr consortium, describes iSAVE as a\ncarefully-designed and thoroughly-tested ventilator-sharing platform. \u201cIt can\nquickly scale up the ventilator infrastructure around the world which is\ncurrently under heavy challenge by the coronavirus epidemic,\u201d he\nsubstantiates.\n\nAdds actor-producer Prakash Bare, the project head at IndVentr: \u201cThis frugal\nsolution costs less than Rs 20,000. It augments perfectly the solution space\nwe have been focusing on.\u201d\n\nProject Prana Foundation President Shriya Srinivasan says her organization and\nthe consortium will offer both low-cost ventilators and multiplexing systems\nto markets in India and neighboring countries.\n\nAccording to Khalil Ramadi, Vice President of the 2005-incepted Foundation,\n\u201cThis effort is poised to equip and greatly expand the capacity of healthcare\nsystems in developing nations.\u201d\n\nThe 2006-founded KSUM is the Kerala government\u2019s central agency for\nentrepreneurship development and incubation activities in the state.\n\nNext  __\n\n### Indventr developing successful partnership With Rajagiri\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Machine Learning provides the system the ability to learn from their previous data and work accordingly in the future without being explicitly programmed.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# What Is Machine Learning and Its Applications\n\nArtificial Intelligence plays a major role in changing the future of the world\nincluding every industry and human being. Artificial intelligence acts as a\ndriver for emerging technologies like IoT, robotics and big data. One of the\nmost important applications of Artificial Intelligence includes Machine\nLearning and it provides the system with the capability to learn from their\nprevious data and work accordingly in the future without being explicitly\nprogrammed.\n\n## Machine Learning\n\nNow let's know more about what machine learning is. It is a branch of\nArtificial Intelligence that provides the system with the ability to access\nthe data in order to look for particular patterns in the data and thus make\nthe system efficient enough to make better decisions in the future. In\ngeneral, it collects sufficient information from the training data and thus\nattains the knowledge enough to make predictions in the future. It has turned\nout to be one of the most influential and powerful technologies in this era.\nWe deal with a lot of data and it is necessary to find a pattern in this data\nand perform all complex decision making and this is what machine learning does\nand with this pattern, we will be able to predict future data. We have to\nallow computers to learn automatically with no human intervention.  \n\nMachine learning could be categorised as follows,\n\n    \n    \n    Supervised Learning\n    \n    Unsupervised Learning\n    \n    Reinforcement Learning\n    \n\n###  SUPERVISED LEARNING\n\nSupervised learning deals with tasks that involve mapping of an input function\nwith respective output based on the input output pair examples.It basically\nteaches or trains the machine to correctly match an input with a correct\nanswer with the help of well labelled training data.\n\nInorder to analyze this let's take an example:\n\n  * Consider we have a basket full of vegetables. Now we have to train the machine detailing of each vegetable.\n  * An object which is round in shape and red in colour: Tomato\n  * An object which seems like a cone and orange in colour: Carrot\n  * Now if we are given a new vegetable and told to identify it by the machine then the machine analyses the previous examples and the features of the new unknown vegetable and matches it accordingly.\n\nThis type of learning is called supervised learning because the training data\nact as a teacher which teaches the system and corrects the mistake until the\nsystem can achieve good performance.\n\nSupervised learning is further classified into classification and regression.\n\n  * Classification: It includes categorising or grouping the data  such as categorizing animals fruits based on its features\n  * Regression: It involves dealing with real-valued targets such as rupees, weights.\n\n###  UNSUPERVISED LEARNING\n\nUnsupervised learning deals with tasks that involve training of the machine\nusing unlabelled or unclassified training data with less human supervision.\nHere you have input variables and no output variables. There is no teacher or\nsupervisor and thus no training is given to the machine. The machine is\nallowed to work on its own and discover details on its own. Thus the task of\nthe machine is to group this data based on the similarities and features they\nobserve without the help of training data.\n\nInorder to analyze this let's take an example:\n\nConsider a baby and her family dog where the baby recognises her dog. Baby\ncould even recognise other dogs as all the dogs share some kind of common\nfeatures.No one is teaching the baby to recognise the dog but she learns all\nby herself. This is a perfect example of unsupervised learning. In the real-\nlife just like the baby the system is provided with a lot of data which is\nneither classified nor labelled but the system on its own analyses and study\nthe data and without any pre-training creates a classification algorithm.\n\nUnsupervised learning can be classified into clustering and association:\n\n  * Clustering: It involves grouping the given set of data into groups based on the similarities.\n  * Association: It creates the set of data which occur or are purchased frequently together.\n\n###  REINFORCEMENT LEARNING\n\nIt is a type of machine learning which trains the machine to make the best\ndecision in a particular situation. This type of learning does not provide any\ntraining data and it learns from its experience. The system performs a trial\nand error environment in order to achieve success in a problem. The system\nfinds a solution to a problem in many ways where there could be rewards as\nwell as errors. The system is not given any hint in order to find the solution\nto this problem and task of the system is to maximise the rewards as many as\npossible and to reduce the errors. In reinforcement, learning decisions are\ntaken sequentially and the next input depends on the output of the previous\ninput. Let's consider a chess game where the system plays with the human.\nEvery move of the system depends on the output of its previous move. Thus\nsystem attains special human skills of taking decisions and learning from\nmistakes.\n\n##  Machine Learning Applications\n\nMachine learning is one of the most trending and important technology right\nnow and its major step in how computers can learn on its own. Applications of\nmachine learning include:\n\n  * Social Media\n  * Web search engine\n  * Virtual Personal assistant\n  * Google translate\n  * Online shopping\n\nSocial Media: Many of the best features in Facebook like face recognition\nfriend suggestions are nothing but the applications of machine learning.\nWhenever you post a picture on Facebook, the system recognises the people in\nthe picture based on the person\u2019s features and their profile on Facebook with\nthe help of machine learning. This is the face recognition application of\nmachine learning. Facebook keeps a tab on the profiles you visit, places and\nuniversities you have been and provides you friend suggestion based on that.\n\nWeb search engine: Google search engine provides better search results with\nthe help of machine learning. The system algorithms watch on how you respond\nto the results shown by them. They provide some top results and if you stay on\nthe page for a longer period, then the system assumes that you have the\nrequired page. If you move from one page to others in less time then it\nassumes you are not satisfied with the result. So with every search, they\nstart providing more and more thus improving the search results.\n\nVirtual personal assistant: Virtual personal assistants like Siri, Alexa\nperforms speech recognition, speech to text conversion, text to speech\nconversion with the help of machine learning. You can instruct the personal\nassistant to do things like to make a call, set an alarm, find the flights\nfrom china to Delhi. The personal assistant collects the information and thus\nlook into related information and past queries related to this or may send a\ncommand to other resources to collect information.\n\nGoogle Translate: When you travel to new places it would be very difficult for\nyou to understand and communicate with the locals and read boards written in\nthe local language. Well, that seems an old situation and now we do have\ngoogle translate in order to make communication easier as it works on many\nlanguages very efficiently. It is one of the best and very useful applications\nof machine learning.\n\nOnline shopping: Suppose you bought a product from or searched for products in\none of the online shopping sites and that start providing you with\nrecommendations that suit your taste. So the system collects information based\non your searches and the products added to your cart, products you liked and\nproducts you bought and thus with the help of this information provides you\nsuggestions. The system also checks what set of products are frequently bought\nby people together and provides the suggestion for that product if the other\nproduct is bought by the customer.\n\nThus machine learning is very useful and has many applications which make our\nlife comfortable and modern.\n\n###  PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS\n\nThe most popular application of ML is predictive analysis, which uses\nhistorical data to make predictions or recommendations for future events. Do\nyou know how your phone starts to provide suggestions of words to use as\nyou\u2019re typing out a text? That\u2019s predictive analysis at work. The system has\nrecorded patterns of the words you actively use in order to provide\nsuggestions for responses in the future.\n\nPredictive analysis is used across a multitude of apps, like e-commerce,\nsocial media, finance, and even transportation. E-commerce apps use predictive\nanalysis to provide consumers with recommendations for other products to\nconsider purchasing. The system detects patterns in items that are commonly\npurchased together and generates suggestions based on these patterns. Social\nmedia does the same, but instead of suggesting products, it recommends people\nto follow. As mentioned earlier, the system collects demographic data from\nusers and (using unsupervised learning) creates patterns to make these\nsuggestions to users.\n\nTons of budgeting apps will use your banking information (after giving\npermissions to link) to help you manage income and spending.

Sinergia Media Labs", "description": "Discover the top Operational Technology (OT) trends of 2025 shaping industries like manufacturing, energy, and utilities. Learn how IT/OT convergence, AI, cybersecurity, and edge computing are driving digital transformation in India and beyond.", "language": "en-US"}, "page_content": "# Top 7 Operational Technology (OT) Trends in 2025 Transforming Indian\nIndustries\n\nThe industrial landscape is witnessing a rapid transformation, driven by\ninnovations in Operational Technology (OT) across sectors like manufacturing,\nenergy, transportation, oil & gas, and utilities. OT encompasses the hardware\nand software systems responsible for monitoring and controlling physical\ndevices, infrastructure, and industrial processes. Traditionally confined to\nisolated environments, these systems are now being reimagined through the lens\nof digital integration.\n\nWith the growing influence of Industry 4.0, smart factories, and the Internet\nof Things (IoT), OT is evolving from basic automation tools to sophisticated\nenablers of enterprise-wide intelligence. Whether it is legacy SCADA systems\nor modern AI-driven analytics, the convergence of OT with IT is unlocking new\nlevels of efficiency, transparency, and decision-making power \u2014 both in India\nand across the globe.\n\nThis transformation, while promising, also brings challenges such as increased\ncybersecurity threats, interoperability hurdles, and the need for skilled\nprofessionals. As we enter 2025, it becomes essential for organisations to\nstay informed about the latest OT trends and to adopt emerging technologies in\na secure, scalable, and sustainable manner.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the top trends that are shaping the future of Operational\nTechnology in 2025.\n\n* * *\n\n### **1\\. IT/OT Convergence: From Siloed Systems to Unified Ecosystems**\n\nOne of the most dominant trends is the deepening integration between\nInformation Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT). Organizations are\nincreasingly adopting platforms that support real-time data sharing between\nenterprise applications and industrial control systems (ICS). This convergence\nboosts efficiency, predictive analytics, and decision-making \u2014 but also calls\nfor stronger governance and cybersecurity measures.\n\n* * *\n\n### **2\\. Rise of Edge Computing in OT Environments**\n\nWith the explosion of IoT and IIoT devices, edge computing is becoming a\ncornerstone of OT infrastructure. Instead of pushing all data to centralized\ncloud servers, edge computing processes critical data locally, enabling faster\nresponse times, reduced latency, and operational resilience even during\nconnectivity disruptions. In sectors like manufacturing, energy, and\nutilities, this is transforming everything from maintenance scheduling to\nsafety automation.\n\n* * *\n\n### **3\\. Enhanced OT Cybersecurity: A Boardroom Priority**\n\nAs OT systems become more connected, they also become more vulnerable. Recent\nyears have seen a sharp rise in ransomware attacks and supply chain threats\ntargeting industrial systems. In 2025, cybersecurity has evolved from an IT\nconcern to an OT imperative. Organizations are implementing Zero Trust\nArchitecture, network segmentation, continuous monitoring, and regulatory\ncompliance (e.g., NIS2, ISA/IEC 62443) to harden their defenses.\n\n* * *\n\n### **4\\. Digital Twins and Predictive Maintenance**\n\nDigital twin technology is gaining traction in OT by enabling virtual replicas\nof physical assets, systems, or processes. These models help operators monitor\nperformance, simulate scenarios, and detect potential failures before they\noccur. Combined with machine learning, this supports predictive maintenance\nstrategies that can significantly reduce downtime and extend asset life.\n\n* * *\n\n### **5\\. AI and Machine Learning Integration**\n\nAI and ML are increasingly embedded in OT environments to unlock insights from\nvast streams of sensor data. Applications include anomaly detection, demand\nforecasting, quality assurance, and process optimization. These technologies\nare not just improving operational efficiency but are also enabling smarter,\nautonomous decision-making on the shop floor.\n\n* * *\n\n### **6\\. Low-Code Platforms for Industrial Automation**\n\nLow-code and no-code platforms are beginning to influence OT as they enable\nfaster deployment of automation workflows, dashboards, and mobile\napplications. This democratization of development empowers plant engineers and\nOT professionals to solve operational problems without waiting for IT\ndevelopers.\n\n* * *\n\n### **7\\. Regulatory Compliance and ESG Reporting**\n\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics are now critical to OT\nstrategy. Industries are using smart OT solutions to track energy usage,\nemissions, waste, and safety incidents in real time. With increasing\nregulatory pressure, compliance reporting tools integrated into OT systems are\nbecoming standard.\n\n* * *\n\n### Embracing the Future of OT in 2025 and Beyond\n\nAs Operational Technology continues to evolve, it is no longer limited to\ncontrol systems or machinery operations \u2014 it is now a cornerstone of\nenterprise-wide digital transformation. The integration of OT with cutting-\nedge technologies such as AI, machine learning, cloud computing, and edge\nanalytics is enabling businesses to become more agile, intelligent, and\nresilient. For Indian industries, especially those navigating challenges\naround infrastructure, skills, and regulatory frameworks, the adoption of\nthese trends is both an opportunity and a necessity.\n\nHowever, true transformation does not come from technology alone. It requires\na strategic roadmap, leadership commitment, workforce enablement, and a strong\nfocus on cybersecurity and compliance. Organisations that embrace these OT\ntrends today will not only improve efficiency and uptime but also gain a\ncompetitive edge in an increasingly digitised global marketplace. Whether\nyou're a manufacturing leader looking to modernise your plant operations, a\nutility provider aiming for real-time insights, or an oil & gas enterprise\nplanning to secure your assets \u2014 the time to act is now.\n\nNext  __\n\n### AI is Changing the Game: How Telecom Connects with You Now\n\nReady for the next step in your digital transformation?\n\nLet's transform your customer experience Contact Us\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n\n#### About Us\n\n  * Company\n  * Clients\n  * Partner Networks\n  * Life @Simelabs\n  * CSR Initiatives\n\n#### Explore\n\n  * Works\n  * Careers\n  * Newsroom\n  * Quick facts\n\n#### Services\n\n  * AR, VR and MR\n  * Business Consulting \n  * Data Engineering \n  * Technology & Engineering \n  * Cloud Services\n\n#### Industries\n\n  * Life Science\n  * BFSI\n  * Healthcare\n  * Satcom\n  * Retail\n  * Manufacturing\n\n#### Latest Thinking\n\n  * Insights\n  * Resources\n  * Videos\n  * White Papers\n\n\u00a9 2025 Sinergia Media Labs is a Private Limited registered in India with\nCompany Identity Number U72900KL2022PTC073839.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY TERMS OF USE\n\n  * About \n  * Services \n  * Career \n  * Work \n  * Insights \n  * Industries \n\nBack\n\n### About\n\nWe are Simelabs, a global digital agency focused on business transformation.\n\nThis is us\n\n#### About -
